FLASH PROGRAMMING THE SG590 THROUGH JTAG
----------------------------------------

The following sequence is what I use on the Mentor Graphics MAJIC-LT
JTAG debugger for programming the flash on the SG590 board.

    fr m boot.bin 0x100000:p
    l flasher
    ed pc = 0
    g

boot.bin is the boot loader that you want to load.
flasher is the sg590 flasher program.
