This is a collection of useful tools, to be documented one day..

- kvg   : kill a running mgetty process with a specified signal, as in:
	  "kvg -1 ttyS0"

- ltest : display state of the serial port control lines (DCD, DTR, DSR,
          RTS, CTS) on systems that support querying them.  Optionally,
	  you can also set the RTS and DTR lines interactively.

	  Run like this: "ltest /dev/ttyS0" or "ltest -k /dev/ttyS0"

- mid   : "modem identify"
