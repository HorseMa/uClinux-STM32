2.2.9a
 - use correct type (socklen_t) for getsockopt (H. Nakano)
 - incorrect return codes fixed (Tomasz Lemiech, Alexey Bortnikov)
 - kernel header dependency removed (asm/bitops.h)
 - ipset now tries to load in the ip_set kernel module if the protocol
   is not available

2.2.9
 - 'ipset -N' did not generate proper return code
 - 'limit' module parameter added to the kernel modules of the
   iphash, ipporthash, nethash and iptree type of sets so that
   the maximal number of elements can now be limited
 - zero valued entries (port 0 or IP address 0.0.0.0) were
   detected as members of the hash/tree kind of sets
   (reported by Andrew Kraslavsky)
 - list and save operations used the external identifier
   of the sets for the bindings instead of the internal one
   (reported by Amin Azez)

2.2.8
 - Nasty off-by-one bug fixed in iptree type of sets
   (bug reported by Pablo Sole)

2.2.7
 All patches were submitted by Jones Desougi
 - missing or confusing error message fixes for ipporthash
 - minor correction in debugging in nethash
 - copy-paste bug in kernel set types at memory allocation
   checking fixed
 - unified memory allocations in ipset

2.2.6
 - memory allocation in iptree is changed to GFP_ATOMIC because
   we hold a lock (bug reported by Radek Hladik)
 - compatibility fix: __nocast is not defined in all 2.6 branches
   (problem reported by Ming-Ching Tiew)
 - manpage corrections

2.2.5
 - garbage collector of iptree type of sets is fixed: flushing
   sets/removing kernel module could corrupt the timer
 - new ipporthash type added
 - manpage fixes and corrections

2.2.4
 - half-fixed memory allocation bug in iphash and nethash finally
   completely fixed (bug reported by Nikolai Malykh)
 - restrictions to enter zero-valued entries into all non-hash type sets
   were removed
 - Too strict check on the set size of ipmap type was corrected 

2.2.3
 - memory allocation bug in iphash and nethash in connection with the SET
   target was fixed (bug reported by Nikolai Malykh)
 - lockhelp.h was removed from the 2.6.13 kernel tree, ip_set.c is
   updated accordingly (Cardoso Didier, Samir Bellabes)
 - manpage is updated to clearly state the command order in restore mode

2.2.2
 - Jiffies rollover bug in ip_set_iptree reported and fixed by Rob Nielsen
 - Compiler warning in the non-SMP case fixed (Marcus Sundberg)
 - slab cache names shrunk in order to be compatible with 2.4.* (Marcus
   Sundberg)

2.2.1
 - Magic number in ip_set_nethash.h was mistyped (bug reported by Rob
   Carlson)
 - ipset can now test IP addresses in nethash type of sets (i.e. addresses
   in netblocks added to the set)

2.2.0
 - Locking bug in ip_set_nethash.c (Clifford Wolf and Rob Carlson)
 - Makefile contained an unnecessary variable in IPSET_LIB_DIR (Clifford
   Wolf)
 - Safety checkings of restore in ipset was incomplete (Robin H. Johnson)
 - More careful resizing by avoiding locking completely
 - stdin stored internally in a temporary file, so we can feed 'ipset -R'
   from a pipe
 - iptree maptype added

2.1
 - Lock debugging used with debugless lock definiton (Piotr Chytla and
   others).
 - Bindings were not properly filled out at listing (kernel)
 - When listing sets from kernel, id was not added to the set structure
   (ipset)
 - nethash maptype added
 - ipset manpage corrections (macipmap)

2.0.1
 - Missing -fPIC in Makefile (Robert Iakobashvili)
 - Cut'n'paste bug at saving macipmap types (Vincent Bernat).
 - Bug in printing/saving SET targets reported and fixed by Michal
   Pokrywka

2.0
 - Chaining of sets are changed: child sets replaced by bindings
 - Kernel-userspace communication reorganized to minimize the number
   of syscalls
 - Save and restore functionality implemented
 - iphash type reworked: clashing resolved by double-hashing and by
   dynamically growing the set

1.0
 - Renamed to ipset
 - Rewritten to support child pools
 - portmap, iphash pool support added
 - too much other mods here and there to list...
