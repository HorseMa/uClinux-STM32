.PP
This function registers function callbacks to occur at a speciifc time in the future. \fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIwhen\fP is an unsigned integer specifying when the callback function will be called in seconds.
.br
\fIflags\fP is an unsigned integer that specifies how frequent the callback function is called in seconds. Should be SA_REPEAT or 0. If flags is set with SA_REPEAT, then the registered callback function will be called every SA_REPEAT seconds. If flags is 0 then the function will only be called once and then removed from the registered alarm list.
.br
\fIthecallback\fP is a pointer SNMPAlarmCallback which is the callback function being stored and registered.
.br
\fIclientarg\fP is a void pointer used by the callback function. This pointer is assigned to snmp_alarm->clientarg and passed into the callback function for the client's specifc needs.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
Returns a unique unsigned integer(which is also passed as the first argument of each callback), which can then be used to remove the callback from the list at a later point in the future using the \fBsnmp_alarm_unregister()\fP function. If memory could not be allocated for the snmp_alarm struct 0 is returned.

.SS "unsigned int snmp_alarm_register_hr (struct timeval t, unsigned int flags, SNMPAlarmCallback * cb, void * cd)"
.PP
This function offers finer granularity as to when the callback function is called by making use of t->tv_usec value forming the 'when' aspect of \fBsnmp_alarm_register()\fP. \fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIt\fP is a timeval structure used to specify when the callback function(alarm) will be called. Adds the ability to specify microseconds. t.tv_sec and t.tv_usec are assigned to snmp_alarm->tv_sec and snmp_alarm->tv_usec respectively internally. The snmp_alarm_register function only assigns seconds(it's when argument).
.br
\fIflags\fP is an unsigned integer that specifies how frequent the callback function is called in seconds. Should be SA_REPEAT or NULL. If flags is set with SA_REPEAT, then the registered callback function will be called every SA_REPEAT seconds. If flags is NULL then the function will only be called once and then removed from the registered alarm list.
.br
\fIcb\fP is a pointer SNMPAlarmCallback which is the callback function being stored and registered.
.br
\fIcd\fP is a void pointer used by the callback function. This pointer is assigned to snmp_alarm->clientarg and passed into the callback function for the client's specifc needs.
