GENERAL
=======

What is it?
----------

  - Various tools relating to the Simple Network Management Protocol
    including:

	* An extensible agent
	* An SNMP library
	* tools to request or set information from SNMP agents
	* tools to generate and handle SNMP traps
	* a version of the unix 'netstat' command using SNMP
	* a graphical Perl/Tk/SNMP based mib browser

    This package is originally based on the Carnegie Mellon University
    SNMP implementation (version 2.1.2.1), but has developed significantly
    since then.

        	http://www.net-snmp.org/



Are there binaries available?
----------------------------

  - There are binaries for some systems available in the binaries
    directory on the ftp site.



What's the difference between UCD-SNMP and Net-SNMP?
---------------------------------------------------

  Not a great deal, really.
  Although the project originally started at UC Davis (hence the name),
  and it has always been based there, most of the contributors have had
  little or no connection with this institution.

    The move to SourceForge was intended to provide a more flexible
  environment for the project, and to distribute the administrative
  workload more evenly.  The change of name simply reflects this move,
  which was the last remaining link with UC Davis.

    The 4.2.x line is the last release line that uses the ucd-snmp name,
  and all releases under this banner will be bug-fixes only.  Release
  5.0 is the first version using the net-snmp name, and all new features
  and significant development will be released under this name.
    (Though the dividing line between a bug-fix and a new feature is
  something of a vague one, so some changes in the 4.2.x line may be
  relatively non-trivial!)
 
    Starting with the 5.0 release, we are also trying to review and
  rework the underlying code base to improve the readability and
  maintainability of the package.  The 5.0 changes have mostly
  concentrated on the agent architecture, though there have been some
  significant changes to the library as well.  Future releases may
  include further restructuring of the library.
    This process will probably result in some changes to the API,
  though we will attempt to retain some form of backwards
  compatibility as far as possible, and clearly mark anything that has
  changed.  The most significant change with the 5.0 release is a
  restructuring of the header file organisation - not least a change
  from <ucd-snmp/xxx.h> to <net-snmp/yyy.h>.



What operating systems does it run on?
-------------------------------------

  Both the applications and the agent have been reported as running
  (at least in part) on the following operating systems:

	* HP-UX (10.20 to 9.01 and 11.0 -- see README.hpux11)
	* Ultrix (4.5 to 4.2)
	* Solaris SPARC/ULTRA (2.8 to 2.3), Intel (2.9) and SunOS (4.1.4 to 4.1.2)
	* OSF (4.0, 3.2)
	* NetBSD (1.5alpha to 1.0)
	* FreeBSD (4.1 to 2.2)
	* BSDi (4.0.1 to 2.1)
	* Linux (kernels 2.4 to 1.3)
	* AIX (4.1.5, 3.2.5)
	* OpenBSD (2.8, 2.6)
	* Irix (6.5 to 5.1)
	* OS X (10.1.1 and 10.1.2)
	* Dynix/PTX 4.4
	* QNX 6.2.1A

  We have also been informed about a port to the Stratus VOS.
  See http://ftp.stratus.com/vos/network/network.html for details.

  See the next question but one for the status of Windows support.

  Certain systems fail to compile particular portions of the agent.
  These can usually be persuaded to compile (at the loss of some
  functionality) by omitting the modules affected.
  See the next question for more details.

  Also note that the presence of a particular configuration in this
  list does not imply a perfect or complete implementation.  This is
  simply what various people have reported as seeming to work. (Or more
  frequently, the configurations people have reported problems with
  that we think we've fixed!)



What happens if mine isn't listed?
---------------------------------

    It's probably worth trying to compile it anyway.  If your system
  is reasonably similar to another supported configuration, it may
  well compile with little or no difficulty.  The most likely source
  of problems will be MIB modules within the agent, as this tends to
  be where the most system-specific code is found.

    If only a few modules fail to compile, try removing them from
  the agent by running "configure --with-out-mib-module=xxx,yyy",
  and re-compiling.  If a large number of modules fail, then it
  might be easier to start from a relatively bare system, using
  "configure --enable-mini-agent --with-defaults".  Then if this
  minimal agent compiles and runs successfully, try adding the
  missing mibgroups using the configure option '--with-mib-module'.
  
    If configure fails with "invalid configuration" messages, or
  you get completely stuck, contact the coders list for advice.
  Similarly, if you manage to get this working on a new system,
  please let us know both details of the hardware you're using,
  and what versions of the operating system you've tried it on.
  The entry 'host' in the file 'config.status' will show this
  information.  Oh, and congratulations!



Does it run on Windows?
----------------------

    The suite should compile and run on Win32 platforms, including
  the library, command-line tools and the basic agent framework.
  Note that the agent now includes support for the MIB-II module,
  but this requires Microsoft's Core Platform SDK.  Instructions
  for how to install this are given in README.win32.

    Some other MIB modules, including the UCD pass-through extensions,
  do not currently work under Windows.  Volunteers to assist in
  these missing modules are likely to welcomed with open arms :-)

    Further details of Windows support (currently Visual C++, MinGW
  and Cygnus cygwin32) is available in the file README.win32



How do I find out about new releases?
------------------------------------

  There is a mailing list for these announcements

  	net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

  To be added to (or removed from) this list, visit
  http://www.net-snmp.org/lists/net-snmp-announce/.  Or you can send a
  message to the address
  'net-snmp-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net' with a subject
  line of 'subscribe' (or 'unsubscribe' as appropriate).

  Major code revisions may be announced more widely (e.g. on the
  SNMP mailing lists, or comp.protocols.snmp) but this list is the most
  reliable way to keep in touch with the status of this package.

  Patches to fix known problems are also made available via the web site:

        http://www.net-snmp.org/patches/



How can I find out what other people are doing?
----------------------------------------------

  There is a general purpose discussion list

  	net-snmp-users@lists.sourceforge.net

  To be added to (or removed from) this list, visit
  http://www.net-snmp.org/lists/net-snmp-users.  Or you can send a
  message to the address 'net-snmp-users-request@lists.sourceforge.net'
  with a subject line of 'subscribe' (or 'unsubscribe' as appropriate).

  To find out what the developers are doing, and to help them out, please
  read the PORTING file enclosed with the package.

  There is also an net-snmp IRC channel set up on the freenode.net IRC
  chat servers (you can use irc.freenode.net to connect and/or see
  http://www.freenode.net/ for getting started with irc).  Multiple
  core developers hang out there on a regular basis.



How do I submit a patch or bug report?
-------------------------------------

  All bug reports should be submitted to the bug database through the
  interface found at http://www.net-snmp.org/bugs/.  Be
  sure to include the version of the package that you've been working
  with, the output of the command 'uname -a', the precise command that
  triggers the problem and a copy of the output it produces.

    All patches should be submitted to the patch manager at
  http://www.net-snmp.org/patches/.  If possible, submit a
  bug report describing the patch as well (referencing it by its patch
  number) since the patch manager doesn't contain a decent description
  field.

    Questions about using the package should be directed at the
  net-snmp-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.  Note that this
  mailing list is relatively busy, and the people answering these
  questions are doing so out of the goodness of their hearts, and in
  addition to their main employment.  Please note the following:

     - use plain text mail, rather than HTML
     - don't resend questions more than once
          (even if no-one answered immediately)
     - include full details of exact commands and error messages
          ("I've tried everything, and it doesn't work" isn't much use!)
     - do *NOT* send messages to -users and -coders mailing lists
          (most developers read both anyway)
     - don't mail the developers privately - keep everything on the list

  Remember that this is basically an unsupported package.  Fundamentally
  it's Open Source, so you have the source code.  If you need something
  fixing badly enough, it's up to you to do the work.

    We can't promise to be able to solve all problems, but we'll
  certainly try and help.  But remember that this is basically an
  unsupported package.  It's Open Source, so if you need something
  fixing badly enough,  fundamentally it's up to you to do the work.



Can I reuse the code in my commercial application?
-------------------------------------------------

  The details of the COPYRIGHTs on the package can be found in the COPYING
  file.  You should have your lawyer read this file if you wish to use the
  code in your commercial application.  We will not summarize here what is
  in the file, as we're not lawyers and are unqualified to do so.



What's the difference between SNMPv1, SNMPv2 and SNMPv3?
-------------------------------------------------------
What's the difference between SNMPv2 and SNMPv2c?
------------------------------------------------


  A full description is probably beyond the scope of this FAQ.
  Very briefly, the original protocol and framework was described
  in RFCs 1155-1157, and is now known as SNMPv1.

    Practical experience showed up various problems and deficiencies
  with this, and a number of revised frameworks were developed to try
  and address these problems.  Unfortunately, it proved difficult to
  achieve any sort of agreement - particularly over the administrative
  framework to use.

    There was less disagreement over the proposed changes to the
  protocol operations.  These included:
        * increasing the range of errors that could be reported
        * introducing "exception values"
            (so a single missing value didn't affect
             the other varbinds in the same request)
        * a new GETBULK operation
            (a supercharged GETNEXT)
        * new notification PDUs
            (closer in structure to the other request PDUs)

  Strictly speaking, it's this revised protocol (originally defined
  in RFC 1905, and most recently in RFC 3416) that is "SNMPv2".

  The only framework based on this protocol that saw a significant
  level of use was "Community-based SNMPv2" or "SNMPv2c" (defined in
  RFCs 1901-1908). This retained the same administrative framework
  as SNMPv1 (with all of the accompanying deficiencies), but using
  the new protocol operations.

  More recently, a new administrative framework has been developed,
  building on the various competing SNMPv2 proposals, and using the
  same SNMPv2 protocol operations.  This is SNMPv3, which is defined
  in RFCs 3411-3418.    It addresses some of the deficiencies of the
  community-based versions, including significant improvements to
  the security of SNMP requests (like it finally has some!).
     SNMPv3 is now a full IETF standard protocol.

  Strictly speaking, SNMPv3 just defines a fairly abstract framework,
  based around the idea of "Security Models" and "Access Control Models".
  It's this combination of SNMPv3 plus accompanying models that actually
  provides a working SNMP system.
     However, the only models in common use are the "User-based Security
  Model" (RFC 3414) and the "View-based Access Control Model" (RFC 3415).
  So "SNMPv3" is frequently used to mean the combination of the basic
  SNMPv3 framework with these two particular models.
     This is also sometimes described as "SNMPv3/USM".


  So in brief:
        - SNMPv2c updated the protocol operations
                  but left the administrative framework unchanged.
        - SNMPv3  updated the administrative framework
                  but left the protocol operations unchanged.



Which versions of SNMP are supported in this package?
----------------------------------------------------

  This package currently supports the original SNMPv1, Community-based
  SNMPv2 (i.e. RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (i.e. RFCs 3411-3418).
    The agent will respond to requests using any of these protocols,
  and all the tools take a command-line option to determine which
  version to use.

  Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452)
  was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package.



Can I use SNMPv1 requests with an SNMPv2 MIB (or vice versa)?
------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

    The version of the syntax used to define a MIB file
  is better referred to as SMIv1 or SMIv2, and is purely
  concerned with defining the characteristics of the
  various management objects.  This is (almost) completely
  unrelated to the versions of the protocol operations.
  So it is quite reasonable to use SNMPv1 requests on
  objects defined using SMIv2, or SNMPv2 (or SNMPv3)
  requests on objects defined using SMIv1.

    The one exception is objects of syntax Counter64,
  which are only accessible using SNMPv2 or higher.
  SNMPv1 requests will either treat such objects as an
  error, or skip over them completely.

  

Where can I find more information about network management?
----------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of sites with network management information on
  the World Wide Web. Three of the most useful are

      http://www.snmpweb.org/
      http://www.snmplink.org/
      http://www.mibdepot.com/

  There are two Usenet newsgroups which are relevant.
	'comp.dcom.net-management'
		which discusses general issues relating to network management
	'comp.protocols.snmp'
		which is specifically concerned with use of SNMP in particular

  (though there is a large overlap between these two groups).
  The SNMP group also has an FAQ (split into two parts) which discusses more
  general issues related to SNMP, including books, software, other sites,
  how to get an enterprise number, etc, etc.
  This is available from

      ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/comp.protocols.snmp/

  or via any of the Web sites above.



Is Net-SNMP thread safe?
-----------------------

  Strictly speaking, no.  However, it should be possible to use the
  library in a thread-safe manner.  This is covered in detail in the file
  README.thread (shipped with the standard distribution), but can be
  summarised as follows:

    -	Call 'snmp_sess_init()' prior to activating any threads.
	This reads in and parses MIB information (which isn't thread-safe)
	as well as preparing a session structure for subsequent use.

    -	Open an SNMP session using 'snmp_sess_open()' which returns an
	opaque session handle, which is essentially independent of any
	other sessions (regardless of thread).

    -	Resource locking is not handled within the library, and is the
	responsibility of the main application.

  The applications and the agent have not been designed for threaded use.
  It should be safe to use the agent library to embed a subagent within
  a threaded application as long as *all* SNMP-related activity (including
  generating traps, and parsing MIBs) is handled within a single thread.



APPLICATIONS
============

How do I add a MIB?
------------------

  This is actually two separate questions, depending on whether you
  are referring to the tools, or the agent (or both).
    See the next question or the next section respectively.



How do I add a MIB to the tools?
-------------------------------

  Firstly,

	cp MY-MIB.txt /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs

          or

        mkdir $HOME/.snmp
        mkdir $HOME/.snmp/mibs
	cp MY-MIB.txt $HOME/.snmp/mibs

  And then,

	export MIBS=+MY-MIB

          or alternatively:

        echo "mibs +MY-MIB" >> $HOME/.snmp/snmp.conf

  Note that you need *both* steps.
  The first command copies the file defining the new MIB to a
  expected location for MIB files.  This defaults to
  /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs (or PREFIX/share/snmp/mibs if the the
  suite was installed into a different base location).  Some
  ready-packaged distributions (such as Linux RPM packages) may look
  for MIB files in a different location, such as /etc/snmp/mibs - put
  the new file in this directory instead.  This makes it available for
  everyone on the system.
  The tools will also look for mibs in your personal $HOME/.snmp/mibs
  directory, but this will only work for you.

  The second command tells the tools to load in this new MIB file as well
  as the default set.   Note that the tools do *not* load every MIB found
  in the directory - this is to avoid slowing them down excessively when
  there is a large collection of MIB files.  If you do want the tools to
  load all the MIB files, set the environmental variable MIBS to the special
  value "ALL".

     Note that the value for this variable is the name of the MIB module,
  *not* the name of the MIB file.   These are typically the same (apart
  from the .txt suffix), but if in doubt, check the contents of the file.
  The value to use is the token immediately before the word DEFINITIONS
  at the start of the file.  Of course, if you load 'ALL' mibs, then this
  distinction is irrelevant.

    Most of the tools (apart from 'snmptable') will work quite happily
  without any MIB files at all, as long as you are prepared to work with
  numeric OIDs throughout.  The MIB files are only used for translating
  between numeric and textual forms for queries and responses.
    The same holds true for the agent - see the AGENT section for details.



Why can't I see anything from the agent?
---------------------------------------

  There are two main general causes of problems retrieving information
  from the agent.   Firstly, the variable (or variables) specified may
  not be recognised by the tools as valid names.  In this case, the
  tools will typically reject the request without ever contacting the
  remote agent.

  Alternatively, the tool may be happy with the request, but the agent
  does not return the corresponding value(s).  It may return an explicit
  error message instead, or the request may time out without any response
  being sent back at all.  The next few entries look at these in more detail.

  A simple way to tell which is the case would be to run the command
  with the command-line option '-d'.  If this displays a dump of the
  packet, then the request is failing at the agent end.  If not, then
  it's the client-side which is dropping the request.



Why can't I see values in the <INSERT ENTERPRISE HERE> tree?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  Having said that there are two main reasons for not getting a response,
  the most likely cause of this problem is actually something else again.

  The 'snmpwalk' command takes a point in the overall MIB tree, and tries
  to display all the values that lie within this subtree.  However, it
  actually does this by issuing a series of "getnext" requests, until
  the variable returned lies outside the subtree of interest.  If the
  very first request returns such an undesired value, then the command
  will terminate, without having displayed anything at all.

    If an expicit starting point is given to 'snmpwalk', then it is reasonably
  clear what is happening, and that there is simply nothing in the subtree
  specified.  However, if 'snmpwalk' is called without giving an explicit
  starting point, then it will display the contents of the 'mib-2' subtree.
  It will not attempt to traverse any 'private.enterprise' subtree, such as
  the UCD-specific objects (including any local extensions).

    To walk the whole tree, specify a starting point of '.iso'
  To walk a specific enterprise subtree, specify the root of this as
  the starting point - e.g:

	snmpwalk -v1 -c public localhost ucdavis
 
  Or, of course, you can walk a selected portion of an enterprise subtree
  by specifying the appropriate starting point - e.g:

	snmpwalk -v1 -c public localhost ucdavis.version
  
  If you still can't see any information, keep reading.  The next few
  questions will probably help you.



Requests always seem to timeout, and don't give me anything back.  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of possible causes of this.

  The most likely are the agent access control settings (who is allowed
  access by the agent itself), or firewall/packet filtering settings
  (who is allowed access by the underlying operating system).

  A fuller list of possible causes (with indications of how to check
  for each) is as follows:
  
	- is the machine you are querying up and running?
		(Does it respond to 'ping' or similar requests?)
	- is there an SNMP agent running on it?
		(Run 'ps -ef | grep snmp' or 'netstat -an | grep 161')
	- are the requests arriving, or being blocked (e.g. by a firewall)?
		(Restart the agent using 'snmpd -f -Le -d'
		 and see if it shows the incoming packet dumps)
	- is the agent simply taking a long time to respond?
		(The 'snmpd -f -Le -d' command should show a series of
 		 incoming PDUs, followed eventually by the outgoing PDUs.
		 Try the request again with a long timeout value,
		 e.g. 'snmpcmd -t 120 ....')
	- do the agent's control settings allow this request?
		(The 'snmpd -f -Le -d' command will show a series of
 		 incoming PDUs with *no* corresponding outgoing PDUs)

  If the agent is not configured to allow access for a particular community,
  then no error response will be returned.  The Net-SNMP tools will retry
  the request a number of times, before reporting a timeout error.

    If the agent is configured to allow partial access for a given
  community, then requests that fall outside this authorised access
  *will* result in an error response.
    (SNMP agents can be very fussy over who they talk to!)

    See the entries on access control in the AGENT section for how to
  configure the Net-SNMP agent to allow suitable access.  For other
  vendors' agents, you will need to consult the relevant documentation.



I can see the system group, but nothing else.  Why?
--------------------------------------------------

  This is almost definitely due to the access configuration of the agent.
  Many pre-configured systems (such as most Linux distributions) will only
  allow access to the system group by default, and need to be configured
  to enable more general access.

    The easiest way to test this is to try a GETNEXT request that ought
  to return the entry of interest.
  e.g.
	snmpgetnext -v1 -c public localhost ucdavis.version.versionTag
  instead of
	snmpget     -v1 -c public localhost ucdavis.version.versionTag.0

  If the agent responds with "end of MIB" or a different object, then
  either the agent doesn't implement that particular object at all, or
  the access control won't allow you access to it.

  See the entries on access control in the AGENT section for how to
  configure the Net-SNMP agent, or consult the agent's own documentation.



The agent worked for a while, then stopped responding.  Why?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  Assuming that the agent hasn't crashed completely, the most likely
  explanation is that it's simply overloaded, and is taking longer to
  respond than the querying tool is waiting.  Since the agent handles
  each request in turn, without regard to earlier activity, and most
  tools will retry a request when it times out, the list of outstanding
  requests can grow longer and longer.

    To determine whether this is the cause, try leaving the agent
  undisturbed for a while, and then probe it using a single 'snmpget'
  or 'snmpgetnext' request, specifying a longer timeout (e.g. '-t 120').
  This should give the agent time to handle the request first time round,
  and avoids overloading it with duplicate requests.

  This is not a full solution, of course, but at least it should
  allow you to isolate the offending portion of the tree. The
  developers may then be able to offer a more long-term solution.



Requesting an object fails with "Unknown Object Identifier"  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------

  If a general snmpwalk shows the entry, but asking for it more
  specifically gives a "sub-identifier not found:" or "Unknown Object
  Identifier" error, then that's a problem with the tool, rather than
  the agent.

    Firstly, make sure that you're asking for the object by the right name.
  Object descriptors are case-sensitive, so asking for 'sysuptime' will
  not be recognised, but 'sysUpTime' will.

    Secondly, the object may be defined in a MIB that hasn't been loaded.
  Try loading in all the MIB files:

	snmpget -m ALL -v1 -c public localhost sysUpTime.0

  (though if snmpwalk displays the object by name, this is unlikely to
  be the cause).

    Thirdly, earlier versions of the UCD software expected "full" paths
  for object names, either based at the root of the whole MIB tree
  (".iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysUpTime") or the 'mib-2'
  subtree ("system.sysUpTime").  Try:
  
	snmpget -v1 -c public myhost system.sysUpTime.0

  These earlier versions of the tools may take a command-line option '-R'
  or '-IR' (depending on vintage) to invoke this "random-access" mode.
  Note that snmptranslate still requires "random-access" to be specified
  explicitly - all other command tools now use this mode by defaults.

  All versions of the UCD and Net-SNMP tools accept the syntax

	snmpget -v1 -c public myhost RFC1213-MIB:sysUpTime.0

  to denote a particular object in a specific MIB module.  Note that this
  uses the name of the *module*, not the name of the file.  See the second
  question in this section for the distinction.



Why do I get "noSuchName" when asking for "sysUpTime" (or similar)?
------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of possible causes of this (scattered throughout
  this FAQ, so keep reading!).   But one of the most likely snares for
  the unwary is forgetting the instance subidentifier for 'non-table'
  objects.  If you walk the 'system' tree, you'll notice that all the
  results (apart from the sysORTable), have a '.0' at the end of the OID.
  This is the "instance sub-identifier" - which *must* be included for
  a GET request.
     Compare the following:

	$ snmpget -v1 -c public localhost sysUpTime
	Error in packet
	Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
	This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime
	$ snmpget -v1 -c public localhost sysUpTime.0
	system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (69189271) 8 days, 0:11:32.71

  This is a little less obscure when using SNMPv2c or v3 requests:

	$ snmpget -v 2c -c public localhost sysUpTime
	system.sysUpTime = No Such Instance currently exists



Why do I sometimes get "End of MIB" when walking a tree, and sometimes not?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This depends on which MIB modules are supported by the agent you are
  querying and what you're asking for.

  Recall that a tree is walked by repeatedly asking for "the next entry" until
  all the values under that tree have been retrieved.  However, the agent has
  no idea that this is what's happening - all it sees is a request for "the
  next entry after X".

  If the object X happens to be the last entry in a sub-tree, the agent will
  provide the next object supported (as requested) even though this will be
  in a different subtree.  It's up to the querying tool to recognise that
  this last result lies outside the area of interest, and simply discard it.

  If the object X happens to be the last entry supported by the agent, it
  doesn't have another object to provide, so returns an "end of MIB"
  indication.  The Net-SNMP tools report this with the message above.

  But in either case, the actual information provided will be the same.



I cannot set any variables in the MIB.
-------------------------------------

  There are three possible reasons for this:

  The majority of MIB objects are defined as "read-only" and inherently
  cannot be changed via SET requests.

  Of those that can in principle be changed, not all have been implemented
  as such in this agent.

  Even if SET support has been implemented, the agent may not be configured
  to allow write access to this object.

  The example configuration file shipped with the basic distribution only
  allows write access for the local host itself (and a suitable community
  name must be configured first).
    Ready-installed distributions (such as those shipped with Linux) tend
  to be configured with read-only access to part of the mib tree (typically
  just the system group) and no write access at all.

  To change this, you will need to set up the agent's access control
  configuration.  See the AGENT section for more details.

    Note that neither the community string "public" nor "private" can be
  used to set variables in a typical default configuration.



Variables seem to disappear when I try to set them.  Why?
--------------------------------------------------------

  This is actually the same as the previous question - it just isn't
  particularly obvious, particularly when using SNMPv1.  A typical
  example of this effect would be

	$ snmpget -v1 -c public localhost system.sysLocation.0
	system.sysLocation.0 = somewhere nearby

	$ snmpset -v1 -c public localhost system.sysLocation.0 s "right here"
	Error in packet.
	Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
	This name doesn't exist: system.sysLocation.0

  Trying the same request using SNMPv2 or above is somewhat more informative:

	$ snmpset -v 2c -c public localhost system.sysLocation.0 s "right here"
        Error in packet.
        Reason: notWritable

  The SNMPv1 error 'noSuchName' actually means:

	"You can't do that to this variable"

  This might be because the variable doesn't exist, it does exist but
  you don't have access to it (but someone else may do), or it exists
  but you can't perform that particular operation (i.e. changing it).
    Similarly, the SNMPv2 error 'notWritable' means "not writable in
  this particular case" rather than "not writable under any circumstances".

  If you are sure that the object is writable (and has been implemented
  as such), then you probably need to look at the agent access control.
  See the AGENT section for more details.



I still can't change sysLocation, though the access settings allow it.  Why not?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One other possibility for the 'sysLocation' and 'sysContact' objects,
  is that you've got a configuration option in the 'snmpd.conf' file which
  already sets the corresponding value there.

    Earlier versions of the agent would allow you to write to these objects,
  but the new value would be forgotten the next time the agent was re-started.
  More recent versions of the agent reject such write requests if there's a
  value set via the config file.   If there isn't such a config setting, then
  the write request will succeed (assuming the access settings allow it), and
  the new value will be retained the next time the agent restarts.



I get an error when trying to set a negative value - why?
--------------------------------------------------------

    This is a different problem.  What's happening here is that the
  routine that parses the arguments to the 'snmpset' command is seeing
  the '-' of the new value, and treating it as a command-line option.
  This normally generates an error (since digits probably aren't valid
  command line option).

    The easiest way to solve this is include the "end-of-option"
  indicator '--' in the command line, somewhere before the new value
  (but after all of the options, obviously).  For example:

	snmpset -v 2c -c public localhost -- versionRestartAgent.0 i -1

  (This will also fail, since -1 isn't an acceptable value for this
  object, but it will be rejected by the agent, rather than confusing
  the snmpset command!)



I get an error when trying to get a string-indexed table value - why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is probably due to the shell swallowing the quotes, before
  they ever get to the SNMP command's OID parser.  Try escaping them:

	snmpget .....   vacmSecurityModel.0.\"wes\"
  or	snmpget .....  'vacmSecurityModel.0."wes"'


  
How do I send traps and notifications?
---------------------------------------

    Traps and notifications can be sent using the command 'snmptrap'.
  The following examples generate the generic trap 'coldStart' and a
  (dummy) enterprise specific trap '99' respectively:

	snmptrap -v 1 -c public localhost "" "" 0 0  ""
	snmptrap -v 1 -c public localhost "" "" 6 99 ""
  
  The empty parameters "" will use suitable defaults for the relevant 
  values (enterprise OID, address of sender and current sysuptime).

    An SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 notification (either trap or inform) takes
  the OID of the trap to send:

	snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost "" UCD-SNMP-MIB::ucdStart
	snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost "" .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.251.1

  (These two are equivalent ways of specifying the same trap).

  Any of these commands can be followed by one or more varbinds,
  using the same (OID/type/value) syntax as for 'snmpset':

	snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost "" ucdStart sysContact.0 s "Dave"

  Generating traps from within the agent is covered in the AGENT and
  CODING sections.

  You should also read the snmptrap tutorial at
	http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/commands/snmptrap.html
  which will help you understand everything you need to know about traps.



How do I handle traps and notifications?
---------------------------------------

    Handling received traps is done using the tool 'snmptrapd'.
  This can log these traps via the syslog mechanism:

	snmptrapd -s -l7	(log to 'LOCAL7')

  printed to standard output

	snmptrapd -f -P

  or pass them to an external command.  This last approach uses
  a 'traphandle' directive in the configuration file 'snmptrapd.conf'.
  A typical file might look something like:

	traphandle .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.5.1       page_me up
	traphandle .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.251.1  page_me up
	traphandle .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.251.2  page_me down
	traphandle default                  log_it

  where 'page_me' and 'log_it' are the command to be run.  (You probably
  need to specify full pathnames, to ensure that the commands will be
  found.  They're just short here for readability).

  Note that the first entry uses the OID corresponding to the SNMPv1
  'coldStart' trap.  See the co-existence RFC (RFC 2576) for details
  of mapping SNMPv1 traps to SNMPv2 OIDs.

  There's a tutorial with more details on the web site at
	http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/commands/snmptrap.html
  


My traphandler script doesn't work when run like this - why not?
---------------------------------------------------------------

    If a traphandler script works fine when run manually from the
  command line, but generates an error when triggered by an incoming
  notification, then this is probably down to one of two likely causes.

    Firstly, the interactive shell environment may not be precisely
  the same as that for programs executed by the snmptrapd daemon.
  In particular, it's quite possible that the PATH environmental
  variable may not include all the additional directories that are
  commonly set up for a personal login configuration.  To avoid this
  problem (particularly for traphandler shell scripts), it's worth
  giving the full path to all programs used within the script.

    Secondly, the snmptrapd daemon may not always recognise the
  appropriate interpreter to use for a particular trap handler.
  If this is the case, then you can specify this interpreter
  explicitly as part of the trap handle directive:

	traphandle default /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/log_it

  Note that in this case, it's almost certain that you'll also
  need to give the full path to the traphandle script (as shown)



The ucdShutdown trap OID received by my manager is wrong. Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------

    This is due to the way that traps are converted between
  SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 formats.  The algorithm used for converting
  from an SNMPv1 enterprise-specific trap number, to an SNMPv2
  trap OID results in a penultimate '0' subidentifier, before
  the trap number itself.  The definition of the trap objects
  in the UCD-SNMP-MIB file does not include this subidentifier.

    In due course, the intention is to define a new set of MIB
  objects, under the 'net-snmp' enterprise tree.  This will
  include new trap OIDs, which will be designed such that
  this problem does not arise in the future.



Why does snmptrapd complain about AgentX?
----------------------------------------

    Starting from the v5 release, the trap handling daemon has
  implemented the notification logging aspects of the NOTIFICATION-MIB
  (RFC 3014).  This is handled by the trap handler daemon registering
  as an AgentX subagent, to supply this statistical information.

    If there is no AgentX master agent available, this registration
  fails, generating the warning about "failed to connect to the agentx
  master".  This warning only appears between version 5.0 and 5.0.4
  (in 5.0.4 and after the warning was silenced).  This failure does
  not affect the main operation of the trap handler.  It simply means
  that the nsmLog information won't be available for query via SNMP.

    Basically, this is a warning that can safely be ignored.



How do I use SNMPv3?
-------------------

    The simplest form of SNMPv3 request (unauthenticated, unencrypted)
  would be something like:

	snmpget -v 3 -l noAuthNoPriv localhost sysUpTime.0

    An authenticated request would specify a username and pass phrase:

	snmpget -v 3 -l authNoPriv -u dave -A "Open the Door"
				localhost sysUpTime.0

    A fully secure request would also specify the privacy pass phrase:

	snmpget -v 3 -l authPriv -u dave -A "Open the Door"
			-X "Bet you can't see me"  localhost sysUpTime.0

  In practise, most of these would probably be set via configuration
  directives in a personal $HOME/.snmp/snmp.conf file (note, *not* the
  agent's snmpd.conf file).  The equivalent settings for the third
  example would be:

	defSecurityName		dave
	defSecurityLevel	authPriv
	defAuthPassphrase	"Open the Door"
	defPrivPassphrase	"Bet you can't see me"

  If the AuthPassphrase and the PrivPassphrase are the same, then you
  can use the setting
		defPassphrase	"Open the Door and see me"
  instead.

  See the AGENT section for how to configure the agent to respond to
  SNMPv3 requests.
 


How big can an SNMP request (or reply) be?
-----------------------------------------

    The protocol definition specifies a "minimum maximum" packet size
  (484 bytes for UDP), which all systems must support, but does not
  attempt to define an upper bound for this maximum size.  This is left
  to each individual implementation.

    The UCD software uses a fixed size buffer of 1472 bytes to hold the
  encoded packet, so all requests and responses must fit within this.
  Unfortunately, it's not possible to predict how many varbinds this
  corresponds to, since it depends on the type and actual values being
  sent, as well as the corresponding OIDs.

    As a rule of thumb, sending 400 integer-valued varbinds seems to
  work OK, while 300 string-valued varbinds triggers an overrun.

    The Net-SNMP releases handle packet buffers rather differently,
  and are not subject to the same fixed restrictions.



How can I monitor my systems (disk, memory, etc)?
------------------------------------------------

    In general, the Net-SNMP suite consists of relatively low-level
  tools, and there is nothing included that is designed for high-level,
  long-term monitoring of trends in network traffic, disk or memory
  usage, etc.

    There are a number of packages available that are designed for this
  purpose.  Two of the most widely used are MRTG (http://www.mrtg.org/)
  and Cricket (http://cricket.sourceforge.net/).  There are details of
  how to set up Cricket to monitor some of the UCD extensions at
  http://www.afn.org/~jam/software/cricket/

     We have also set up a page that describes in detail how MRTG
  can be set up to monitor disk, memory and cpu activity at
  http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/mrtg/index.html

    There is also a web-based network configuration system "Net-Policy",
  based upon SNMP.  This is not strictly connected to the Net-SNMP project,
  but a number of the core developers are also involved with that system.
  See http://net-policy.sourceforge.net for more details.



Applications complain about entries in your example 'snmp.conf' file.  Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The example configuration file 'EXAMPLE.conf' is designed as a config
  for the agent, and should be installed as 'snmpd.conf' (note the 'd').
  The file 'snmp.conf' is intended for general configuration options,
  applicable to all applications (via the SNMP library).
    Rename (or merge) the 'snmp.conf' file to 'snmpd.conf', and this should
  fix the problem.
    Note that there is no example snmp.conf shipped with the standard
  distribution.



OK, what should I put in snmp.conf?
----------------------------------

    This is used to set common configuration values for most of the
  applications, to avoid having to specify them every time.  Examples
  include the SNMPv3 settings mentioned above, defaults for which MIBs
  to load and where from, and the default SNMP version, port and
  (if appropriate) the community string to use.

    Some of these (such as the MIB file location), might belong in a
  shared snmp.conf file (typically /usr/local/share/snmp/snmp.conf or
  /etc/snmp/snmp.conf) to apply to all users of the system.  Others
  (particularly the SNMPv3 security settings), are more likely to refer
  to a particular user, and should go in a personal snmp.conf file
  (typically $HOME/.snmp/snmp.conf).

    Note that the Net-SNMP package does not come with an example snmp.conf
  file.  See 'snmpget -H' and/or the snmp.conf(5) man page for more details.

    You can also use the "snmpconf" command to help you generate your
  snmp.conf configuration file (just run it and answer its questions).



PERL
====

Where can I get the perl SNMP package?
-------------------------------------

  Joe Marzot's excellent perl SNMP module, which requires the ucd-snmp
  library, is now included in the ucd-snmp source release.  It's
  located in the perl/SNMP subdirectory of the ucd-snmp source tree.

  It can also be found at any Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
  (CPAN) site mirror in modules/by-module/SNMP.  To find the CPAN site
  nearest you, please see http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html.

  With the v5 release of the Net-SNMP suite, this is now accompanied by
  a number of perl modules grouped together under the NetSNMP namespace.

  Consult the README file in the SNMP perl module distribution to find 
  out what version of the ucd-snmp library it needs to be linked against.



How do I install the Perl SNMP modules?
--------------------------------------

  Assuming you have a reasonably new (and properly configured) perl system,
  this should be simply:

        cd perl		(for 5.0.x)
  or    cd perl/SNMP	(for 4.2.x)
	perl Makefile.PL
	    (press RETURN when prompted for host and community)
	make
	make test
	make install  (probably as root)

  Note that with the 5.0 release line, there are additional SNMP-related
  perl modules that should probably be installed as well.  These can also
  be found under the 'perl' subdirectory.  At the very least, install the
  'default_store' module.
    This is not necessary with the 4.2.x releases.



But compiling this fails! Why?
-----------------------------

  The perl module tends to delve quite deeply into the internals of the
  main Net-SNMP library, and so is quite sensitive to changes within the
  library.  It's important to use the correct version of the module, that
  corresponds to the version of the library you have installed.  If you're
  working with the main Net-SNMP distribution, the appropriate version of
  the perl module is shipped as part of this, but you *must* have
  run "make install" on the main Net-SNMP distribution *first*.

  If you're working with a ready-installed version of the library, make
  sure you obtain a compatible version of the perl module.

    Note that the perl modules will be compiled using the compiler
  (and compiler settings) used for compiling the original perl binary,
  *not* those used for compiling the Net-SNMP (or UCD) library.
  If these are different (e.g. 'gcc' used for one and 'cc' for the other)
  then this may well cause problems.  It's much safer to use a consistent
  environment for both.  This issue is discussed in greater detail in
  the README.solaris file.

    Also note that the v5 Net-SNMP suite *must* be configured to provide
  shared libraries in order for the perl modules to work correctly.  This
  is not necessary with the v4 UCD-SNMP libraries.



Compiling the perl module works OK, but 'make test' fails. Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------

  That's difficult to answer in general.
  Some of the perl tests are rather picky, so this may simply be
  some minor inconsistency between your precise setup, and the
  expectations of the test environment.

    Check that you are working with the perl distribution that matches
  the SNMP libraries (use the 'perl/SNMP' in preference to CPAN), and
  that you have installed the main libraries successfully (uninstall
  any old versions if you're having trouble).

    If all this looks OK, and if most of the tests pass, then it's
  probably safe to run 'make install' anyway.   Probably.



The perl 'make test' fails on the OID tests. Is it safe to continue?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  No.  Almost certainly not.  If the "perl/OID" tests fail the first
  four tests, and then crashes out complaining about a "netsnmp_oidPtr",
  then this is a sign of a more fundamental problem.

  The 4.2.x line perl support was a single module, so was independent
  of the way that the C library was configured.  In contrast to this, 
  the 5.0.x perl support consist of a number of inter-cooperating modules,
  which rely on sharing a consistent C library environment.  In practise,
  this means that the perl modules *MUST* be configured and compiled using
  a shared version of the C library.   Unfortunately, the default for
  most early versions of the Net-SNMP suite was to compile using static
  libraries unless explicitly configured to use shared libraries.  The
  default should be to use shared libraries from 5.0.7 onwards.

  The error "oid1 is not of type netsnmp_oidPtr" is a fairly sure indication
  that the C library was compiled statically.   You'll need to re-configure
  the main Net-SNMP package using the "--enable-shared" configure flag.
  Then re-install the C library before re-configuring and re-compiling
  the perl module support.

  Note that this problem does not arise when using the 4.2.x version
  of perl support.



I'm trying to use mib2c (or tkmib) and it can't locate SNMP.pm?
------------------------------------------------------------

  That's probably because the SNMP perl module hasn't been installed.
  It's not part of the standard perl distribution, nor is it installed
  by default in RedHat Linux (for example).
    You'll need to install it.  See the previous two questions.



I'm trying to use mib2c (or tkmib) and it can't load SNMP.so?
------------------------------------------------------------

    This is probably the same problem.  Either the SNMP module
  hasn't been installed, or it's the wrong version.  See the
  previous two questions.



I'm trying to use tkmib and it can't locate Tk.pm?
-------------------------------------------------

  Tk.pm is another Perl package that needs to be installed before tkmib
  will run.  It's also available on Perl CPAN.  We suggest using version
  "Tk800.011" or later.  It can be installed by issuing the command:

		perl -MCPAN -e shell ; "install Tk"



I'm trying to install your RPM, but it complains about missing perl modules. Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This has been particularly noted on RedHat 9, complaining about the
  module "perl(Term::ReadKey)" - even if this is actually present (e.g.
  having been installed directly from CPAN).  In fact, this is not
  specific to perl modules - the same issue can potentially arise with
  other RPM dependencies.

  The problem is that the RPM mechanism keeps a local database of what
  software packages have been installed, and checks this for any other
  features that this RPM requires.  If software is installed "manually"
  rather than via rpm packages, then it will not appear in this database.
  Attempting to install another RPM that rely on this functionality will
  then complain about the "missing" package, because the RPM system doesn't
  know that's it's actually available.

  The ideal solution is to *always* install software using a consistent
  mechanism (which may involve building RPMs locally, or looking for a
  suitable pre-built version).

  Failing this, it's possible to tell the "rpm" command to ignore such
  dependencies, and install the package anyway.  Try:

              rpm -i --nodeps {package}

  In this situation, it's then up to you to make sure that any other
  necessary packages *are* actually present on the system.



I've got a problem with the Net-SNMP module.  Can you help?
----------------------------------------------------------

  Sorry, despite the similar-sounding name, the Net-SNMP (or Net::SNMP)
  module is nothing to do with this package, or the NetSNMP modules.
  Net::SNMP is a "pure-perl" implementation of SNMP support, developed
  by David Town.  The developers of the (C-based) Net-SNMP suite do
  not have any significant experience in using this particular module,
  and you'll probably be better off asking for help via CPAN or some
  other perl-related forum.



MIBS
====

Where can I find a MIB compiler?
-------------------------------

  That depends what you mean by a "MIB compiler".  There are at least two
  types of tool that are commonly referred to by this name.

  The first is a tool to check MIB files for validity.  This functionality
  is mostly integrated within the MIB parser (part of the Net-SNMP library)
  and hence included in all the applications.  The tool 'snmptranslate' is
  probably the most appropriate for this purpose.
    Note that the parser is fairly forgiving (see 'What ASN.1 parser is used'
  below), so this should not be regarded as a stamp of approval.

    The second type of tool is one to turn a MIB specification into C code,
  specifically one designed to aid agent implementation.  The command 'mib2c'
  is an example of such a tool for the Net-SNMP agent.  
  See the CODING section for more information.



I can't load any of the mib files, and they seem to be missing
the first two characters of the filename.  What's happening?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  This is a problem experienced with Sun systems when the tools have
  been compiled with a mixture of BSD and Solaris environments.
  You'll need to re-configure and compile the tools, making sure that
  '/usr/ucb' is not in your PATH (or at least comes at the end).



Why aren't my mib files being read in?
-------------------------------------

    The Net-SNMP library only loads a subset of MIB files by default.
  This list is set at when the suite is first configured and compiled,
  and basically corresponds to the list of modules that the agent supports.
  (This is a simplification, but is a reasonable first approximation).

    You can override this by using the command-line option '-m', the
  environmental variable 'MIBS' or the snmp.conf directive 'mibs'.
  Each of these take a (colon-separated) list of MIB module names
  to load.   Starting the list with a '+' character will add them to
  the default list - otherwise it replaces the defaults.

    Using the special value 'ALL' will load all the MIB files that
  the library can find.


    Alternatively, the tools may be looking in the wrong place.
  The default location for the mib files is /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs.
  Again, this is set when the suite is first configured and compiled.
  This can be changed using the environmental variable 'MIBDIRS'
  or the snmp.conf directive 'mibdirs'.

    Note that this may very well affect you if you've installed a
  new version of the suite manually, replacing one provided by the
  supplier (which typically would use a more 'central' location).


    Finally, are you sure that you've installed the MIB files?
  If you've compiled the suite from scratch, you need to run
  "make install" at least once, before the tools will be able to
  find the MIB files.  This is unlikely to be a problem if you've
  been working with the tools for a while, but can bite those coming
  fresh to the SNMP world.



I'm getting answers, but they're all numbers. Why?
-------------------------------------------------

  This is actually the same as the previous question.  Because the tools
  don't read in every MIB module they can find, it is quite possible
  for results from an agent to refer to modules that have not been loaded
  (particularly with GETNEXT requests, or when walking a tree).
     The tools will report the answer quite correctly, but won't translate
  identifiers and enumerations into readable strings.  To fix this, use
  the environmental variables MIBS or MIBFILES (or the '-m' and '-M' flags)
  to read in the relevant module files.



What does "Cannot find module (XXX-MIB)" mean?
---------------------------------------------

    This is similar to the previous questions.   In this case, it's
  stating that it can't find the specified module - either because
  it's not installed properly, or the name used is subtly wrong.

    If it's just one or two modules that are not being found, check
  that the files are in the expected location, are readable, and the
  name being used is correct.  Note that the name reported is the
  name of the MIB module, which is not necessarily the same as the
  name of the file. See the question 'How do I add a MIB to the tools?'
  for more details on this.

    If the tool is generating a whole slew of errors, then it's
  likely that either the MIB files haven't been installed at all,
  or the library is looking in the wrong place.   See the previous
  two questions.



What about "unlinked OID"?
-------------------------

    This means that the library has been able to find the MIB module,
  and parse the individual objects defined in it, but is having problems
  linking them together into a consistent tree.  In particular, it
  can't find an object corresponding to the name within the braces
  (i.e. the 'xxx' in '{xxx 99}').

    This is probably due either to a typo in this name (remember that
  names are case sensitive, so a reference to 'xxx' will *not* match
  a definition of 'Xxx'), or else the name is defined in another MIB
  file, and this dependency is missing from the IMPORT clause of this
  MIB file.



The parser doesn't handle comments properly. Why not?
------------------------------------------------------------

  The most likely reason is that the line in question contains two
  (or more) sequences of pairs of dashes.  This is often used to try
  and "comment out" an unwanted line that already contains a comment:

	--   broken ::= { myMIB 1 }   -- This isn't working yet

  The assumption here is that a comment continues to the end of the line.
  Unfortunately, this assumption is not correct.
    A comment will continue either to the end of the line, or the next
  occurance of a pair of dashes.  Thus in this case, the definition of
  "broken" is commented out (as intended) but the following text is
  treated as part of the MIB, and will generate an error.

    A similar effect can be obtained when a line of dashes has been used
  to try and mark separate parts of a MIB file.

    Most of the applications have a command-line option (-Pc) which will
  work around this problem by treating the whole line as a comment.  But
  this is not strictly legal, and the offending MIB file should really be
  corrected.



How do I replace MIB values with new ones?
-----------------------------------------

  The Net-SNMP parser generally takes the first definition it sees for each
  object in the MIB hierarchy.   Even if you specify your file to be read
  first, if the IMPORTS clauses reference a MIB with competing objects,
  those objects will be parsed first.

  When specifying the Replace MIB command-line option (-PR), the parser
  will use definitions sourced from the most recent MIB file.
  The parser will replace MIB objects when the sub-identifier and name match.

  Caution: Using Replace MIB, there is NO guarantee that the resulting
  MIB tree will be correct.  Other MIB objects matching the name but
  not the sub-identifier will persist.  Sub-hierarchies may be reparented.
  In particular, random access searching [see man 1 snmpcmd]
  may give unexpected result.
  The Replace MIB option is experimental, buyer beware, carpe diem, etc.

  Here are a few considerations to help you obtain good results.
  These hold true even if you never use the Replace MIB feature.
  Your suggestions for improvement are welcomed.

    1. The parser searches the specified directories and attempt
       to parse every file whose path does not begin with "." (period).
       Remove (or rename) older MIB files from these directories.
       Rename "README" to ".README" , etc.

    2. Hint: the parser's module list is in LIFO order. You may see better
       results if the directory with the most correct MIB files is
       specified last in the MIBDIRS environment.

    3. Constrain the parser to not read in default MIB files by setting
       the MIBS environmental variable to the appropriate separator character
       (semi-colon on win32, colon everywhere else).
       Setting this to "" may also have the same effect.

    4. The MIBFILES environment can specify the path of the new MIB file.

  Within a program, the call:
	 /*  4.2.x  */
	 ds_set_boolean(DS_LIBRARY_ID, DS_LIB_MIB_REPLACE, 1 | 0);

  or, if using the 5.0.x series code:
	/*  5.0.x  */
	netsnmp_ds_set_boolean(NETSNMP_DS_LIBRARY_ID,
			       NETSNMP_DS_LIB_MIB_REPLACE, 1 | 0);

  will enable or disable the Replace MIB feature respectively.
  If you're having problems loading a particular MIB file, this
  call can be used to disable this feature, before using read_mib() to
  load the required file, and then re-enabling the Replace MIB feature.
  (or vice versa, as appropriate).



How can I get more information about these MIB file problems?
------------------------------------------------------------

  The command 'snmptranslate' is used to translate between numeric
  and symbolic forms of OIDs.  It uses the same routines as the
  'active' commands, but does not rely on communicating successfully
  with a network management agent.  As such, it is a useful tool
  for identifying problems with reading in MIB files.

    In particular, the following options may be useful in
  identifying problems:
	-Pw  warns about conflicting symbols
	-PW  prints more verbose warnings about other problems as well
		(in both cases, ignore the 'xmalloc' reports)
	-T   provides sub-options for various views of these entries

  There are other '-P' options to control various aspects of MIB parsing.
  See the 'snmptranslate(1)' and 'snmpcmd(1)' man pages for more details,
  or the tutorial at
	http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/commands/snmptranslate.html



What's this about "too many imported symbols"?
---------------------------------------------

  Any MIB file starts with an (optional) list of identifiers that
  it "imports" from other files.  The parser implements this using
  a fixed size buffer to hold the import information.
    There are two circumstances in which this can result in the
  error message shown above.

    Firstly, if the MIB file refers to an unusually large number
  of external identifiers.  Handling this case requires a (trivial)
  patch to the parsing code.  Contact the coders list for advice.
     (This is extremely rare - the only example that
      we've come across is the Cabletron Trap MIB).

    Much more common is a syntax error in the IMPORTS clause of the
  MIB file in question.  In particular, check that this ends in a
  semicolon, before going on to the main definition section.



Do I actually need the MIB files?
--------------------------------

  Probably not.
  The MIB files play two main roles - they are used to translate
  between numeric OIDs and the corresponding textual names, and
  they define the structure and syntax of the relevant MIB objects.

    This second role is perhaps best thought of in terms of a design
  document.  It's vital while developing an application (typically
  the MIB module or handler within the agent), since it defines
  what the application (MIB) must actually do.  But once the code
  has been written, the design document becomes redundent.
  The agent then has the same information hardcoded into it
  (literally!), and no longer needs the MIB file.

    The translation task is not strictly necessary - SNMP will
  operate fine without any MIB files at all, as long as you're
  happy to work with numeric OIDs throughout, and know which MIB
  objects you're interested in.  But it's much easier to work with
  the (hopefully) meaningful names, enumeration tags and the like,
  and to view the description of a particular object.
  This requires having the relevant MIB files installed and loaded.



AGENT
=====

What MIBs are supported?
-----------------------

  The following MIBs are supported (at least in part and on some systems):

	- MIB-2  General network statistics (RFC 1213)
	- Host Resources (RFC 1514 and 2790)
	- SNMPv3 MIBS (RFCs 2571-5, 3411-3418)
		(including USM, VACM, Target
		 and Notification MIBs)
	- DisMan EVENT-MIB
	- MTA-MIB (sendmail)
	- private agent extensions
		(monitor specified processes and disks,
		 memory, CPU, load average, plus extend
		 the agent using shell commands)

  The Host Resources MIB, the Event MIB and the MTA MIB are not
  included by default, and need to be explicitly requested when
  the suite is first configured and built.

  There are a few other MIB implementations distributed as part of the
  source tarball, but these are basically unsupported and most of the
  core developers have little or no experience with using them.



What protocols are supported?
----------------------------

  The agent supports all three current versions of SNMP (v1, v2c and v3),
  over both UDP and TCP transports, as well as a SMUX (RFC 1227) master
  agent, AgentX (RFC 2257 ) in both master and subagent roles, and SNMP
  proxying.



How do I configure the agent?
----------------------------

  That depends on what you want it to do.  See the snmpd.conf(5) manual
  page for the possibilities.

  You can also run the "snmpconf" perl script to help you create this
  file.  Start off with 'snmpconf -g basic_setup' to get you going.



How do I add a MIB to the agent?
-------------------------------
How do I add functionality?
--------------------------

  While simply adding a file to the MIB directory (and possibly tweaking
  the list of MIBs to load) is sufficient for the tools, unfortunately
  extending the functionality of the agent to include this is not so simple.
  In fact, the agent makes little or no use of these files, and will work
  quite happily without them.  All the information about the syntax and
  scope of the variables supported is hardwired into the implementation
  of the agent.

  There are a number of alternative ways to add functionality for a new
  MIB to the agent.

  Firstly, it is possible that the agent distribution already includes
  the desired functionality, but this has simply not been configured in
  to the running version.  This is done using the configure option
		--with-mib-modules="list"
  (where "list" is a space-separated list of modules to include) then
  recompiling the agent.
  Note that some functionality concerned with monitoring and managing
  unix hosts is included in the UCD extension modules, which are located
  within the 'private' branch of the MIB tree.  This is covered in a later
  question in this FAQ.

  Secondly, it is possible for the agent to run commands or shell scripts
  in response to queries.  These can obtain and report the necessary
  information, or perform actions as required.
  Detailed information and examples are provided in the snmpd(8) and
  snmpd.conf(5) manual pages, and the EXAMPLE.conf file.
  This is known as "pass-through" support.

  Thirdly, it may be possible to link another agent (which already
  supports the desired MIB), as a "subagent" of the Net-SNMP master
  (or vice versa).  The possibilities here are SMUX, AgentX or proxied
  SNMP (see the next question but one).

  Finally, the agent itself can be extended to support additional MIB
  groups, by writing the necessary C code, and including this within
  the main agent - either statically compiled in, or dynamically loaded.
  This is covered further in the next section.

    Note that there is no visible difference between 'pass-through'
  MIB support, subagents, and modules implemented within the main agent
  itself. Tools querying the agent will see a single MIB structure.
 


How do I remove a MIB from the agent?
------------------------------------

  Deleting the text file for a MIB does not affect the agent, other than
  to prevent it from recognising textual names instead of raw OIDs in the
  config files. There are three options to prevent the agent returning
  information from a particular MIB:
                                                                                
    1) re-run configure to exclude the given MIB module, rebuild,
       and reinstall:

	./configure --with-out-mib-module=host   ....
	make
	make install

    2) use access control to exclude the mib from the view used to
       query the agent:
                                                                                
                                                                                
	com2sec public  default public

	group   public  v1      public
	group   public  v2c     public

	view    ourmib  included  system
	view    ourmib  included  printmib
	view    ourmib  excluded  host
	view    ourmib  included  privatemib

	access  public  "" any noauth exact ourmib none none
                                                                                
    3) disable the MIB at runtime

       First you need to figure out which MIB modules are being
       loaded by getting the agent to report them as they are
       initialised:

	  snmpd -Dmib_init -H

       Then turn off the ones you don't want:

	  snmpd -I -hr_system,hr_storage,hr_device,hr_other,....



I've installed a new MIB file.  Why can't I query it?
----------------------------------------------------

    Unfortunately, simply installing the MIB file isn't enough for
  the agent to automatically provide the corresponding information.
  This typically requires writing some code.
    See the section CODING, and the on-line documentation.

    It may sometimes be possible to achieve the same effect using
  the various extension directives, but this typically still involves
  providing a suitable script or command.   The agent isn't magic
  and doesn't know how to locate the MIB information.  Somebody
  has to tell it.



What's the difference between 'exec', 'sh' and 'pass'?
-----------------------------------------------------

    'exec' will fork off the specified command and return the exit status
  and/or the output.  Arguments are passed directly to the command.

    'sh' is similar, but invokes a shell to run the command line given.
  This means that quoted arguments will be recognised as such, and also
  allows redirection, and other similar shell interpretation.

  Neither of these mechanisms require the command to have any
  knowledge of the fact that they are being used in this manner.
  But the output is returned in a fixed format, and it is up to
  the receiving application to interpret this appropriately.

  Note that with the 4.2.x and 5.0.x lines, return values are cached
  within the agent for 30 seconds, rather than invoking the command
  for every request.  This does not hold for the 5.1.x agent.


    'pass' is a more general mechanism for extending the agent, and the
  command given will be invoked for any request within the specific MIB
  subtree.  Details of precisely how this command will be called in
  various circumstances is given in the 'snmpd.conf(5)' man page.

    'pass-persist' is similar, but the command will continue running
  even once the initial request has been answered.

  See 'snmpd.conf(5)' for more details.

  

What's the difference between AgentX, SMUX and proxied SNMP?
-----------------------------------------------------------

    All three are protocols that can be used to make two or more agents
  appear as one to the querying application.  In each case, one agent
  takes the role of "master", and delegates requests to one of the others
  as and where this is appropriate.  The differences between them mainly
  relate to how data is represented, and the mechanisms for communication
  between master and subagents.

    SMUX and proxy SNMP both essentially use the standard SNMP packet format.
  The main difference is that a proxy SNMP subagent need not be aware that
  it is acting in such a role.  It typically listens on a non-standard port,
  and simply receives requests as usual, forwarded from the master agent. 
  The main issue to be aware of is that such requests will usually appear
  to come from the local host, and this may affect how the access control
  mechanisms need to be set up.

    SMUX uses a similar packet format, but the subagent "registers" with
  the master agent, providing a suitable password.  The Net-SNMP (and UCD)
  agent includes the possibility of acting as a SMUX master agent, but the
  suite does not include a subagent API.   Note that the SMUX protocol has
  essentially been superceded by AgentX, but is still provided in order to
  support existing SMUX subagents.  However the core developers have little
  experience (and even less interest!) in this code, so assistance with
  SMUX-related problems is likely to be somewhat limited.
    See the file 'agent/mibgroup/README.smux' for details.

    AgentX uses a more compact (and simpler) packet format, with a richer
  range of administrative commands, and provides a more flexible and reliable
  extension mechanism.  The Net-SNMP agent can be used in both master and
  subagent roles, and the agent library can also be used to embed an AgentX
  subagent within another application.
    See the file 'README.agentx' for details.

  Note that support for SMUX is not configured in by default.  You will
  need to run configure with the option

		--with-mib-modules=smux

  Starting from release 4.2.1, AgentX support is now included by default,
  but needs to be explicitly activated in the master agent.  Do this by
  adding the line

		master agentx

  to the snmpd.conf file before starting the agent.  Note that there are
  a number of known problems with the AgentX support in the 4.x line, and
  this should not be used on production systems.  The 5.0 AgentX support
  has been significantly improved, and production use is less foolhardy.
    See README.agentx for details.



What about 'dlmod' - what's that about?
--------------------------------------

  Dynamically loaded modules are a means of including a MIB implementation
  module within the main SNMP agent (or an AgentX subagent) without needing
  to re-compile and re-link the agent binary.  Instead, details of the
  module(s) to load are specified in the configuration file, and the agent
  locates the files listed, and merges them in at run time.

  See http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/toolkit/dlmod/ for more information.



Which should I use?
------------------

  That's a difficult question.

  Comparing the three protocols, SNMP was not originally designed
  as an internal subagent-communication protocol, and there are
  certain architectural limitations to SMUX, which were addressed
  as part of the design of AgentX.  These include such aspects as
  reliable handling of SET requests (particularly in the face of
  failures), a common value for sysUpTime, and a mechanism for
  sharing tables across multiple subagents.
    So from a purely functional point of view, AgentX is the most
  appropriate choice for subagent communication.

  In terms of implementation, SMUX is the most mature of the three,
  but is no longer being actively maintained.  The original author
  has moved on, and the current developers don't use this facility.
  It also only includes master agent support - the package does not
  provide a SMUX sub-agent API.
    The AgentX support in the 4.x line has a number of known problems,
  and is not suitable for use in front-line situations (though it's
  probably sufficiently stable and functional for simple day-to-day
  use).  The 5.0 agent has seen a significant amount of development,
  and is a much more reliable beast.
    Bear in mind that the AgentX and proxy SNMP implementations are
  relatively new code, so have not received the same level of active
  service that the core agent has.  But with that caveat, either of
  these options should be suitable for most use.

    This decision will probably be dictated by external considerations
  (i.e. the other agents you need to combine with).  Ideally, you
  should be looking towards AgentX, but this is not always possible.

  Dynamically loaded modules serve a somewhat different purpose,
  and are purely concerned with how the individual MIB implementation
  modules are located.  These can be combined with either a "pure SNMP"
  model, an AgentX subagent or a proxied SNMP agent.  They will involve
  a slightly greater load on agent start-up (plus an extra level of
  complexity if things go wrong) - balanced against the ability to
  avoid re-compiling and re-linking a working binary.

    Note that as far as individual MIB modules are concerned, the
  protocol used to transport the request is more or less irrelevant.
  The same information is being requested (or set) each time, so
  a MIB module ought to be protocol-independent.  This was one of
  the design aims of the AgentX support, and the exact same module
  code can be included as part of a pure-SNMP master agent, or an
  AgentX subagent, either compiled in or dynamically loaded with no
  modifications needed to the MIB module code itself.



Can I use AgentX when running under Windows?
-------------------------------------------

  Yes, but there are a couple of things to be aware of.

  Firstly, by default the AgentX master listens on the Unix domain
  socket '/var/agentx/master', which doesn't work under Windows.
  You'll need to tell it to listen on a TCP port, either by using
  the command-line option "-x localhost:705",  or by adding the
  directive "agentxSocket localhost:705" to the snmpd.conf file.

  Secondly, be aware that the security of AgentX connectivity is not
  particularly strong.  The examples given here would allow any process
  running on the local machine to register as an AgentX subagent.  The
  more obvious settings "-x 705" or "agentxSocket 705" would allow
  a system *anywhere* on the network (or even from remote networks) to
  register as an AgentX subagent.  This could potentially be used to
  hijack the agent, or provide false information.



Can I use AgentX (or an embedded SNMP agent) in a threaded application?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  With care.

  As mentioned in the earlier "thread-safe" FAQ entry, the Net-SNMP
  agent (including the AgentX subagent) has not been designed for
  threaded operation.  In particular, it makes use of various global
  variables without attempting to protect them against simultaneous
  use.  This means that it is *NOT* safe to have SNMP or AgentX
  related processing in two separate threads.  This also applies to
  handling GET (and SET) processing in one thread, and generating traps
  in another.  This is still vulnerable to the usual threading problems.

    However, as long as *all* of the SNMP-related activity is limited
  to the one thread, then there should be no reason why this cannot
  safely communicate with other threads within the same application,
  using private (thread-safe) mechanisms.

    But in terms of the Net-SNMP-provided code, the agent (and AgentX
  subagent) should *not* be regarded as thread-safe.



How can I run AgentX with a different socket address?
----------------------------------------------------

  There are two sides to an AgentX connection, and they need to
  agree about which socket address to use.  So if you want to use
  a different socket, you need to configure both sides accordingly.

  For the Net-SNMP master agent, this is done using the command-line
  option '-x'.  The command
		"snmpd -x localhost:705 ...."
  would start the agent listening on the TCP port 705 for connections
  from the local system.  Or the same effect can be obtained by adding
  the line
		agentxsocket localhost:705
  to the file snmpd.conf

  The main Net-SNMP agent can also be run in a "subagent" mode, and
  this uses the same command-line option to specify a different
  AgentX socket.  So
		"snmpd -X -x localhost:705 ...."
  would start it as a subagent, and connect to the master agent
  listening on TCP port 705 on the same system.

  A subagent running embedded within some other application will
  typically not understand the same command-line options.  This
  will need to set the same configuration programmatically.
  For example, the example subagent driving code from the Net-SNMP
  "subagent program" tutorial (on the project web pages) could
  be made to connect to the same TCP port by adding the line
     netsnmp_ds_set_string(NETSNMP_DS_APPLICATION_ID,
                           NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_X_SOCKET, "localhost:705");
  before the 'init_agent' call.

  The same approach can also be used to listen on a different named
  socket, using:
		agentxsocket /tmp/agentx
		agentxperms 777 777 myuser mygroup
  or
		snmpd -x /tmp/agentx ....
  or
     netsnmp_ds_set_string(NETSNMP_DS_APPLICATION_ID,
                           NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_X_SOCKET, "/tmp/agentx");
  as appropriate.
  But also see the mention of AgentX security (or the lack of it!)
  in the previous entry.



How can I turn off SMUX support?
-------------------------------

  Unfortunately, it's not currently possible to disable the SMUX
  initialisation using '-I'.   If it's not possible to recompile
  from source (having reconfigured without SMUX), the simplest way
  to disable this functionality is to get the agent to bind to an
  invalid IP address.

  If you put a line such as

	smuxsocket  1.0.0.0

  in the snmpd.conf file, the agent will whinge at startup,
  but won't accept any incoming SMUX requests.

  If the agent complains about not recognising the "smuxsocket"
  token, then you're out of luck.  You'll either have to recompile
  from source, or use local firewall rules to block connections
  to port 199.



How can I combine two copies of the 'mib2' tree from separate subagents?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  With the 4.x line agent, you can't.  Sorry about that.

  With the 5.0 agent, this is possible by using the SNMPv3 context string
  to distinguish between parallel MIB trees.  This can be set up for an
  individual MIB implementation module when it registers itself with the
  main agent framework (either directly, or via AgentX).  It can also
  be set up for a proxied subagent as part of the proxy configuration
  entry (see 'snmpd.conf(5)').
    This facility is not currently available for SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c
  requests (although it ought to be possible to use the community
  string in a similar way).

    Another way to handle this would be to tweak one of the subagents to
  use a different set of (non-standard) OID assignments - perhaps by
  relocating the whole of the subtree to another (private) OID.  This
  is not ideal, but should work with all configurations.



What traps are sent by the agent?
--------------------------------

  The agent sends a 'coldStart(0)' trap when it first starts up, and an
  enterprise-specific trap 'nsNotifyShutdown' (or 'ucdShutdown') when it
  stops.  It can also be configured to send an 'authenticationFailure(4)'
  trap when it receives an SNMPv1 request using an unknown community name.
  The Net-SNMP agent generates an enterprise-specific trap 'nsNotifyRestart'
  (rather than the standard 'coldStart(0)' or 'warmStart(1)' traps) on
  receiving a HUP signal - typically after being re-configured.

    The agent does not send 'linkUp' or 'linkDown' traps by default.  The
  Net-SNMP agent can be configured to do this using the 'monitor' config
  directive.  See the 'snmpd.conf(5)' man page (under DISMAN-EVENT-MIB)
  for details (including the need for an 'agentSecName' setting).

    Similarly, it does not generate traps by default when one of the
  monitored characteristics (disk usage, running processes, etc) enters or
  leaves an error state.  This can be configured using the 'defaultMonitors'
  config directive (also documented under DISMAN-EVENT-MIB).  Note that
  these facilities are only available with the v5 Net-SNMP agent, and are
  not supported by the v4 UCD agent.



Where are these traps sent to?
-----------------------------

    With all these alerts, the agent also needs to be configured with
  (one or more) destinations to send them to, specifying the type of
  notification (v1 or v2 trap, or v2 inform) and the community name to
  use.  This uses the snmpd.conf directives 'trapsink', 'trap2sink' and
  'informsink' for the destination type, and 'trapcommunity' for the
  community name.  SNMPv3 destinations can be configured using the directive
  'trapsess'.   See the 'snmpd.conf(5)' man page for details.

    Note that these directives control the type of notification that is
  generated.  This is completely separate from the style of API used to
  request that the notification should be sent.  If a module invokes the
  v1-style API 'send_easy_trap', this will still send SNMPv2 notifications
  to destinations configured using 'trap2sink' or 'informsink' (and vice
  versa).

    A configuration block such as

        trapsink   localhost
        trap2sink  localhost
        informsink localhost

  will result in *three* notifications being sent for each call to
  'send_easy_trap' (or 'send_v2trap').  See 'snmp_trap_api(3)' for details.

    Note that all notifications will be sent to all destinations.  The
  agent does not (currently) support notification filtering.
 


How can I send a particular trap to selected destinations?
----------------------------------------------------------

    With the v4 UCD agent, this isn't possible (or at least not
  easily).  When you request the agent to generate a trap (using
  either 'send_v2trap' or 'send_easy_trap'), this will be sent
  to *all* the known destinations.

    The v5 Net-SNMP agent introduced preliminary support for the
  snmpNotifyFilterTable which is designed to allow this sort of
  selective trap direction, though this is not currently active.
  (The tables are present, but the information is not consulted)
  Documentation on how to use this facility will appear once the
  functionality is working properly.



When I run the agent it runs and then quits without staying around. Why?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Firstly, are you certain that this is what is happening?

  The normal operation of the agent is to 'fork' itself into the
  background, detaching itself so that it will continue running even
  when you log out, and freeing the command line for subsequent use.
  This looks at first sight as if the agent has died, but using 'ps'
  to show all processes should reveal that the agent is still running.

  To prevent this behaviour (such as when attempting to debug the
  agent), you can start it with the '-f' flag.  This suppresses the
  fork, and the agent will run as a 'normal' command.  It's also often
  useful to use the '-L' (or '-Le') flag, to log messages to stdout.

  On the other hand, if 'ps' shows that the agent is not running, then
  this is an error, and probably show that something went wrong in
  starting the agent up.  Check the agent log file for any error messages,
  or run it with '-f -Le' and see what it reports.

  One known example of this is the 'ucd-snmp' RPM distributed by RedHat.
  This agent crashes if there is a 'disk' configuration entry in the
  snmpd.conf file.  It is not currently known what causes this, as this
  setting works correctly if the agent is compiled from source.

  Another possible cause might be an existing agent (or some other process)
  that's already listening on the SNMP port.  Trying to start a second
  agent will fail with an error about "opening the specified endpoint".

  If you're starting the agent as a non-root user, then this may also
  fail with the very same error.  By default, the agent (and trap handler)
  will attempt to listen on the standard SNMP port 161 (or 162 for the
  trap handler).  These are defined as "privileged ports", and processes
  will need to be running as root in order to open them.

  One way to tackle this is to start the agent as root, but use the -u
  option to switch to run as another user once the port has been opened.
  Alternatively, you can specify a different port to use instead.
  Anything greater than 1024 is available to non-root users.  In this case,
  you'll also need to specify the same port when issuing client commands.



After a while the agent stops responding, and starts eating CPU time.  Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This is most commonly seen when performing an "snmpwalk" on an agent
  that's either using a default "vendor provided" configuration
  (typically access to the 'system' group only), or which is trying
  to restrict access for individual users or communities to a subset
  of the whole OID tree.

  The agent implementation of "GetNext" processing is relatively
  inefficient when dealing with inaccessible objects, and it is quite
  easy for the clients to time-out and retry a request, while the agent
  is still trying to process the original.  If this happens continually
  (as is typically the case with an snmpwalk), the agent can get swamped
  by this backlog.

  The 5.0.x line has now addressed this, starting with the 5.0.7 release.
  The 4.2.x line still suffers from this problem, and it is unlikely that
  this will be fixed.  (The 5.0.7 approach relies on some of the new
  features in the 5.0.x line, and it has not proved possible to apply
  this to the 4.2.x code base).



How can I stop other people getting at my agent?
-----------------------------------------------

  Firstly, are you concerned with read access or write access?

  As far as changing things on the agent is concerned, there is relatively
  little that can actually be altered (see the answer to " I cannot set
  any variables in the MIB" above).

    If you are using the example config file, this is set up to allow
  read access from your local network, and write access only from the
  system itself (accessed as 'localhost'), both using the community name
  specified.  You will need to set appropriate values for both NETWORK
  and COMMUNITY in this file before using it.
    This mechanism can also be used to control access much more precisely.
  (see the next few questions for details)

  Other options include:
	- Blocking access to port 161 from outside your organisation
		(using filters on network routers)
	- Using kernel-level network filtering on the system itself
		(such as IPTables)
	- Configuring TCP wrapper support ("--with-libwrap")
		This uses the TCP 'libwrap' library (available separately)
		to allow/deny access via /etc/hosts.{allow,deny}

  For strict security you should use only SNMPv3, which is the secure
  form of the protocol.  However, note that the agent access control
  mechanisms does not restrict SNMPv3 traffic by location - an SNMPv3
  request will be accepted or rejected based purely on the user
  authentication, irrespective of where it originated.



How can I listen on just one particular interface?
-------------------------------------------------

    Normally, the agent will bind to the specified port on all interfaces
  on the system, and accept request received from any of them.  With
  version 4.2, the '-p' option can be used to listen on individual
  interfaces.  For example,
	
			snmpd -p 161@127.0.0.1

  will listen (on the standard port) on the loopback interface only, and

			snmpd -p 6161@10.0.0.1

  will listen on port 6161, on the (internal network) interface with address
  10.0.0.1.   If you want to listen on multiple interfaces (but not all),
  then simply repeat this option for each one:

		snmpd -p 161@127.0.0.1 -p 6161@10.0.0.1

  The v5 Net-SNMP agent has a similar facility, but does not use the '-p'
  command line option flag.  Instead, the ports and/or interfaces to listen
  on are simply listed on the command line, following any other options.  Also,
  the syntax of port and interface is slightly different (interface:port).
    So the three examples above would be

			snmpd 127.0.0.1:161
			snmpd 127.0.0.1:6161
			snmpd 127.0.0.1:161 127.0.0.1:6161

  The AgentX port option ('-x') works in much the same way, using the
  "host:port" syntax (in both 4.2 and 5.0 lines - and yes, this *is* an
  inconsistency in 4.2!)



How do I configure access control?
---------------------------------

    The simplest way is to use the configure directives:

		rocommunity public	(for SNMPv1/2c)
		rwcommunity private
  or
		rouser user1		(for SNMPv3)
		rwuser user2

  These specify the community names or security names to accept for
  read-only and read-write access to the whole of the supported MIB tree.
  (Obviously you should change these names to match your requirements -
  which is a particularly good idea in the case of 'rwcommunity'!)

  Note that it is *not* necessary (and not advisible) to specify the
  same community name for both rocommunity and rwcommunity directives.
  The rwcommunity setting automatically includes rocommunity access,
  and having both lines (with the same community name) may result in
  apparently inconsistent behaviour.  Only use both settings when
  specifying *different* community names.
    The same holds true for rouser and rwuser.

  All four of these settings can can also be restricted to particular
  subtrees, and/or request sources.  See 'snmpd.conf(5)' for details.

  These directives are effectively wrappers round the core access control
  mechanism, which uses the four directives 'com2sec', 'group', 'view'
  and 'access' to provide a more efficient and flexible control
  over who can access which portions of the tree.

    See the next question for the gory details, and the entry after
  that for setting up SNMPv3 users.



I don't understand the new access control stuff - what does it mean?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  The idea behind the new access control model is to give a more flexible
  way of specifying who can see and do what within the MIB tree.
  It's more complicated to understand than the simple example above, but
  that's because it can do a whole lot more.

    There are four configuration keywords in the new scheme:
	'com2sec', 'group', 'view', and 'access'

  We'll consider these one at a time, starting with 'access'.
  (Because I feel like starting with the last one, that's why - OK?)


  The "access" keyword has the job of specifying who has access to
  which bits of the MIB tree.  This has eight parameters, so can look
  rather offputting. Most of these can be safely left with default values
  in most cases (so don't you worry your pretty little head about them).
  The syntax is

	access {group} "" any noauth exact {read-tree} {write-tree} {notify-tree}

  where the entries in braces need to be defined elsewhere (I'm coming
  to that - be patient!), and the rest can be left as shown here.

	[ If you really want to know, the 'sec.model' field can 
	  be used to have an access line that's only relevant to
	  particular versions of SNMP (such v1 or v2c) rather than
	  "any" version, and the 'sec.level' field to ensure that
	  the request must be authenticated or encrypted.
	    The context and prefix fields can be used to distinguish
	  between parallel versions of the same overall OID tree
	]


  The "view" keyword is used to define particular bits of the MIB tree,
  for use in the last three field of the access entry.
  This has the syntax

	view  {name}  included/excluded  {subtree}   {mask}

  where {name} is the identifier to be used for this view (i.e. what should
  appear in the access entry), and {subtree} is the portion of the MIB tree
  that this name refers to (in either numeric or named form).
    Note that the name of the view does not have to have anything to do
  with the MIB sub-identifier names - it's purely an identifying tag for
  use within the config file (though choosing a meaningful name is, as
  always, a very good idea).
  
    The {mask} field can be used to control which elements of the OID subtree
  should be regarded as relevant when determining which view an OID is in.
  Normally, the whole of the OID should be included, and in this case the
  mask field can be omitted.  See snmpd.conf for a description of how this
  might be used.
  The third field can be used to include or exclude particular portions
  of the MIB from the view, and different lines can use the same view name
  to build up a more complicated view, if that's what's needed.

    The three view fields in the access line are used to control which
  portions of the MIB tree a particular {group} can see (GET et al),
  alter (SET), or request NOTIFYs on.



    That's dealt with the "what" - now for the "who".
  This is the role of the "group" and "com2sec" entries.

  The "group" keyword gives general control, by mapping between a "security
  name" (for a particular protocol version), and the internal name used in the
  access line.  Note that the token "any" is no longer acceptable for the
  security model - the original support for this was due due to a misreading
  of the RFC.  You should replace any such line with separate versions for
  each of the desired security models ('v1', 'v2c' & 'usm').

    For SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, the group line is just an intermediate step
  between the "access" line and the "com2sec" line, which is the last bit
  of the jigsaw.  The "com2sec" entry is used to determine a "security name"
  from the traditional community string, taking into account where the request
  has come from.  Thus the same community string can give access to  different
  portions of the tree, depending on where the request is sent from.

     For example, in an earlier version of the example config file, there
  were two com2sec lines with the community string "public" - one was valid
  from anywhere (with the security name "public") and one was only valid
  from the local network (using the security name "mynet").
     The group lines converted these security names into the groups "public"
  and "mygroup" respectively, and the access lines gave these two groups
  the ability to GET values in the 'system' sub-tree (from anywhere) or
  the 'mib-2' sub-tree (from the local network).  Neither of these could
  SET any values though, (since the write-tree was "none" in both cases).
    Someone on the local machine, using the community string "private",
  had the security name "local" and the group name "local", and hence had
  full access (both GET and SET, as well as NOTIFY) to the whole of the
  MIB tree (or at least everything under .1, which covers most things!)

     Note that the three occurrences of "public", as community string,
  security name and group name, were three totally separate things.
  You can't use a community string in a security name field, or either
  of these as a group name (or vice versa), unless you set up suitable
  entries to map one name onto the other.

    With SNMPv3, the security name is part of the basic protocol, and can
  be used directly in a group definition.

  And here concludes our tour of the view-based access control mechanism.
  Phew!



How do I configure SNMPv3 users?
-------------------------------

  There are three ways to configure SNMPv3 users:

  1) Stop the agent, and create a file /var/ucd-snmp/snmpd.conf,
     containing the line

	createUser {myUser} MD5 {myPassword} DES

    (where {myUser} and {myPassword} are the appropriate values,
    _without_ the braces!).  Then re-start the snmpd agent.

  2) Stop the agent, run the command

        net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user

     and follow the instructions.  This will create an entry
     in the /var/ucd-snmp/snmpd.conf file similar to the above.
     Then re-start the snmpd agent.

  3) Make sure the agent is running, and will respond to a suitable
     existing SNMPv3 user (with the same Authentication and Encryption
     protocols as required for the new user).  Then use the 'snmpusm'
     command to clone this template user, and change the password.


  See the access control entries above and the file 'README.snmpv3'
  for more details about how to use SNMPv3 users,

  Note that simply having a 'rouser' or 'rwuser' line does *not*
  automatically create the corresponding user.  You will need the
  above 'createUser' line (or an equivalent 'usmUser') as well.



The 'createUser' line disappears when I start the agent.  Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------

    That's deliberate.   The agent removes the (human-readable) 'createUser'
  directive, and replaces it with an equivalent 'usmUser'.  This
  contains the same information, but in a form that's only meaningful
  internally.  This means that the password is not longer stored in
  a human-readable form.  Additionally, the password has been converted
  to a key that can only be used to access the local machine.  If someone
  stole the new usmUser line on this machine, they could not use that
  information to access any of your other agents.



What's the difference between /var/ucd-snmp and /usr/local/share/snmp?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Most "static" agent configuration should go in the traditional location
  (typically /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf or /etc/snmp).   The
  /var/ucd-snmp (or /var/net-snmp) location is used for information set during
  the running of the agent, which needs to be persistent between one run of
  the agent and the next.

    Putting the 'createUser' line in this persistent file is an exception,
  for security reasons (see above).  In general you shouldn't need to put
  anything else here.



My new agent is ignoring the old snmpd.conf file. Why?
-----------------------------------------------------

    The most likely explanation is that the new version of the agent is
  looking in a different location than the previous one.  This is commonly
  experienced when replacing a ready-installed version (e.g. from a vendor
  distribution), with the current release installed from the source.

    The default location for this file with the basic distribution is
  /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf (or PREFIX/share/snmp/snmpd.conf).
  Ready-installed versions often look for the file as /etc/snmpd.conf,
  or /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.  Try moving the old config file to the new
  location, and restart the agent.

    With release 5.0, the name of the package changed from "ucd-snmp"
  to "net-snmp", and this change was reflected in the name of the persistent
  /var directory.  So a v5 Net-SNMP agent will not look in
  /var/ucd-snmp/snmpd.conf for settings from a v4 UCD agent.



Why am I getting "Connection refused"?
-------------------------------------

    This is actually nothing to do with the access control mechanism
  (though that's an understandable mistake).  This is the result of
  the TCP wrapper mechanism using the files 'hosts.allow' and 'hosts.deny'
  to control access to the service.  Some distributions may come with
  this enabled automatically - otherwise you need to explicitly activate
  this by configuring using '--with-libwrap'.

  If TCP wrappers are enabled, and both hosts.allow and hosts.deny are
  empty, then all requests will be rejected (with "Connection refused").
  The simplest way to avoid this problem and allow incoming requests is
  to add the line

		snmpd: ALL

  to the file /etc/hosts.allow (or wherever this file is on your system).
  Though be aware that doing this removes one level of protection and allows
  anyone to try and query your agent (though the agent's own access control
  mechanisms can still be used to restrict what - if anything - they can see).

  If you do wish to use the TCP wrappers to restrict access, it's sensible
  to have an explicit entry:

		snmpd: ALL

  in the file /etc/hosts.deny, which makes it crystal clear that access
  to the SNMP agent has been denied.  This mechanism can also be used to
  restrict access to specific management hosts, using a hosts.deny entry
  such as:

		snmpd: ALL EXCEPT 127.

  which will allow connections from localhost, and nothing else.

  Note that personal firewalls (such as Linux' ipchains or iptables
  mechanism) may have a similar effect (though typically this won't
  be logged).  See the earlier entry
    Requests always seem to timeout, and don't give me anything back.  Why?


 
I'm getting errors about "bad security model" - why?
----------------------------------------------------

  Until release 4.2, the access control handling accepted the token "any" 
  to cover all of the recognised security models.  This is explicitly
  forbidden in the relevant RFC, so support for this is being withdrawn.
    As an interim measure, it is currently accepted (with the warning you
  see), but this will not be the case in future releases of the agent.
 
    You should replace the token 'any' with 'v1', 'v2c' or 'usm' as
  appropriate.  If you want to support all three of these security models,
  you'll need to use three distinct group lines, one for each. See the
  example snmpd.conf file for details.

  

I'm getting errors about "bad prefix match parameter" - why?
------------------------------------------------------------

  This is similar to the previous question.  With 4.2, the syntax of the
  'access' configure line has changed, and a value of '0' is no longer
  acceptable for the sixth field.  Simply replace this with the word 'exact'.


  
Why can't I see values in the UCDavis 'extensible' or 'disk' trees?
------------------------------------------------------------------

  Both these trees are designed to report things you ask it to report
  on.  If you don't declare anything in the snmpd.conf file for it to
  monitor, it will not report anything.  See the snmpd.conf manual page
  and the EXAMPLE.conf file for details on configuring the agent.

  Optionally, run snmpconf -g monitoring to help you set up this
  section of the snmpd.conf file.



Why can't I see values in the UCDavis 'memory' or 'vmstat' trees?
----------------------------------------------------------------

  These mib modules are not supported on all operating systems, and
  will not be included on any other system.  Currently, they are only
  supported on Linux, HP-UX (memory only), Solaris, BSDi (vmstat on
  BSDi4 only), Dynix, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
    If you want to help port it to other systems, let us know.

  Note that these subtrees only report the current usage when
  explicitly queried.  They do *not* generate traps when the
  usage strays outside the configured bounds.
  See the earlier FAQ entry
    What traps are sent by the agent?



What do the CPU statistics mean - is this the load average?
----------------------------------------------------------

  No.  Unfortunately, the original definition of the various CPU statistics
  was a little vague.  It referred to a "percentage", without specifying
  what period this should be calculated over.  It was therefore
  implemented slightly differently on different architectures.

    Recent releases includes "raw counters", which can be used to
  calculate the percentage usage over any desired period.  This is
  the "right" way to handle things in the SNMP model.  The original
  flawed percentage objects should not be used, and will be removed
  in a future release of the agent.

    Note that this is different from the Unix load average, which is
  available via the loadTable, and is supported on all architectures.



How do I get percentage CPU utilization using ssCpuRawIdle?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  This one of the "raw counters" mentioned in the previous entry.
  You need to take two readings of this object and look at the
  difference between them.  That difference divided by the total
  number of 'ticks' between the two readings (where one tick is
  probably 0.01 seconds) will give you the percentage utilization
  over that period.



What about multi-processor systems?
----------------------------------

    Sorry - the CPU statistics (both original percentages, and the
  newer raw statistics) both refer to the system as a whole.  There
  is currently no way to access individual statistics for a particular
  processor (except on Solaris systems - see below).

    Note that although the Host Resources table includes a hrProcessorTable,
  the current implementation suffers from two major flaws.  Firstly, it
  doesn't currently recognise the presence of multiple processors, and
  simply assumes that all systems have precisely one CPU.  Secondly, it
  doesn't calculate the hrProcessorLoad value correctly, and either returns
  a dummy value (based on the load average) or nothing at all.

    As of net-snmp version 5.1, the Solaris operating system delivers some
  information about multiple CPU's such as speed and type.

    Other than that, to monitor a multi-processor system, you're currently
  out of luck.  We hope to address this in a future release of the agent.
  But you've got the source, so you can always have a go yourself :-)



The speed/type of my network interfaces is wrong - how can I fix it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    Some operating systems will provide a mechanism for determining
  the speed and type of network interfaces, but many do not.  In such
  cases, the agent attempts to guess the most appropriate values,
  usually based on the name of the interface.

    Version 4.2 allows you to override these guessed values, using the
  configuration directive 'interface', specifying the name, type and
  speed of a particular interface.  This is particularly useful for
  fast-ethernet, or dial-up interfaces, where the speed cannot be
  guessed from the name.

    See the snmpd.conf(5) man page for details.
  


The interface statistics for my subinterfaces are all zero - why?
----------------------------------------------------------------

    Unfortunately, most kernels that support multiple logical
  interfaces on a single physical interface, don't keep separate
  statistics for each of these.  They simply report the overall
  statistics for the physical interface itself.

    There's no easy way around this problem - the agent can only
  report such values as it can find out.  If the kernel doesn't
  keep track of these figures, the agent can't report them.

    Sorry!



Does the agent support the RMON-MIB?
-----------------------------------

    Not really.

    There is an "Rmon" code module included within the agent source
  code tree, but this is best thought of as a template for the
  RMON-MIB statistics groups, rather than a full implementation.

    With most MIBs, the hardest part of implementing the MIB is often
  getting hold of the data to report.  This is definitely true of the
  RMON-MIB, which relies on gathering (and analysing) a potentially
  large quantity of network traffic.   The Rmon code distributed with
  the Net-SNMP agent code avoids this problem, by using random data.

    Some of the functionality of the RMON-MIB, such as the alarm and
  event groups, has since been superceded by the work of the DisMan
  IETF working group.  The Net-SNMP agent does implement these (more
  general) MIB modules.  But the statistics gathering aspects of
  the RMON-MIB are not readily available.

    Note too that none of the core developers have any significant
  experience with this code, and the person who originally wrote it
  is no longer active on the mailing lists.  So there's no point in
  asking on the lists whether these modules work or not.  You've got
  the source - how badly do you need this functionality?



What does "klread:  bad address" mean?
-------------------------------------

  This means that the agent was unable to extract some of the
  necessary information from the kernel structures.  This is
  possibly due to:
	- either looking in the wrong place for kernel information
		(check the value of KERNEL_LOC)
	- an error in the implementation of part of the MIB tree
		for that architecture.  Try and identify which
		OID is generating the error, and contact the
		list 'net-snmp-coders@lists.sourceforge.net'
		Remember to tell us what architecture you have!



What does "nlist err:  wombat not found" (or similar) mean?
----------------------------------------------------------

  This means that the agent wasn't able to locate one of the
  kernel structures it was looking for.  This may or may not
  be important - some systems provide alternative mechanisms
  for obtaining the necessary information - Solaris, for example,
  can produce a whole slew of such messages, but still provide
  the correct information.
    This error only occurs if you have used the flag
  '--enable-debugging' as part of the initial configuration.
  Reconfigure the agent with '--disable-debugging' and these
  messages will disappear.  (It won't fix the underlying problem,
  but at least you won't be nagged about it).



How about "Can't open /dev/kmem"?
--------------------------------

  This device is normally restricted to just being accessible by root
  (or possibly by a special group such as 'kmem' or 'sys').  The agent
  must be able to read this device to obtain the necessary information
  about the running system.
    Check that the agent was started by root, and is running with UID 0
  (or suitable GID if appropriate).  The agent will normally continue
  to run without this level of access permission, but won't be able to
  report values for many of the variables (particularly those relating
  to network statistics).

 

The agent is complaining about 'snmpd.conf'.  Where is this?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  It doesn't exist in the distribution as shipped.  You need to
  create it to reflect your local requirement.
    To get started, you can either just create this as an empty file,
  or run snmpconf to help you create one.
    See the snmpd.conf(5) manual page for further details.



The system uptime (sysUpTime) returned is wrong!
-----------------------------------------------

  Oh no it's not.
  The defined meaning of 'sysUpTime' is
	"the time ... since the *network management*
	 portion of the system was re-initialized."

  In other words, when the snmp agent was started, not when the
  system itself last booted.  This latter information is available
  in the Host Resources MIB as "host.hrSystem.hrSystemUpTime"
  Note that even if the full Host Resources is not supported on
  your system, it's worth configuring in the system portion using

		'--with-mib-modules=host/hr_system'

  and recompiling.  This particular group is reasonably likely to
  work, even if some of the other more system-specific groups don't.



Can the agent run multi-threaded?
--------------------------------

  Short answer - no.
  Longer answer - not easily.

  Net-SNMP within a single thread of an threaded application is fine,
  as long as *all* snmp code is kept within the same thread. This lets
  you add SNMP support to an existing threaded application.

  If you are concerned with the time taken for to process requests for
  a particular agent, object or subtree, and you want the agent to
  continue to respond to other requests in the meantime, there are
  two options.

  The first method is using AgentX sub-agents. If you have several
  tables, each implemented by a separate subagent, then a single
  request for entries from each of the tables will be processed
  in parallel (and the agent will continue to respond to other
  requests while it waits for the subagents to return the necessary
  information).  But a request for several objects from the same
  table will be passed off to the relevant subagent, where it will
  (normally) be processed serially.

  The second method is to use delegated requests + IPC to another
  process.  If takes a long time to retrieve a value for a given object,
  then the object handler could do whatever necessary to start or
  communicate with another (non-SNMP) process/thread to actually
  retrieve the value, and mark the request as delegated.
    The main agent (or subagent) can then receive and process other
  requests while waiting for the delegated request to finish.
  Dealing with resource contention is all up to you.

  All of this only applies to the GET family of requests.  A SET
  request will block until all pending GET requests have finished,
  and then will not accept new requests until the SET is complete.

  Adding full multi-thread support directly to the agent would be
  nice.  We just need someone with time/money to do/sponsor the work.



COMPILING
=========

How do I compile with 'cc' instead of 'gcc'?
-------------------------------------------

  Run configure with --with-cc=cc

  Note that if you've already run configure once, it will probably have
  detected the presence of 'gcc', cached this information, and may still
  try to use this anyway.   In which case, simply remove the 'config.cache'
  file before re-running configure.
 


But gcc doesn't compile it successfully on my new Solaris system. Why not?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Whenever you upgrade the operating system under Solaris, you need to
  reinstall gcc, and run the 'fixincludes' script.  (This is probably
  a sensible step to take when you upgrade any operating system).
    Under Solaris 2.6, there is also a bug in the gcc 'fixinc.sv4' script.
  This needs an additional line as follows:

*** fixinc.svr4.cln     Thu Jun 15 22:03:29 1995
--- fixinc.svr4 Tue Nov 25 09:47:57 1997
***************
*** 191,191 ****
--- 191,192 ----
          s/__STDC__ - 0 == 0/!defined (__STRICT_ANSI__)/g
+         s/__STDC__ - 0 == 1/defined (__STRICT_ANSI__)/g

  NOTE: This appears to have been resolved.



On RedHat 8.0 or up I get "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lelf"?
----------------------------------------------------------

  A typical installation of RedHat 8.0 and up doesn't always include
  the full set of 'libelf' library links.  In order to build Net-SNMP
  you may need to install the 'elfutils-devel' RPM.

  A alternative quick fix is to add the missing symbolic link, using:

    ln -s libelf.so.1 /usr/lib/libelf.so

  (or whatever the correct library is on your system).
  This is typically only needed when you've configured the agent to
  include the Host Resources MIB support ('--with-mib-modules=host').



What about '-lbz2' or '-lselinux' errors?
----------------------------------------

  This is the same basic problem - the relevant development RPMs
  have not been installed.  You should either install them
  (bzip2-devel and libselinux-devel respectively), or create
  any missing symbolic links by hand:

    (cd /usr/lib ; ls -s libbz2* libselinux*)
    ln -s libbz2.so.1     /usr/lib/libbz2.so
    ln -s libselinux.so.1 /usr/lib/libselinux.so



What about a failed dependency on 'libcrypto'?  Where can I get that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is typically encountered when installing a Linux RPM of
  the ucd-snmp package.  This library is part of the 'openssl'
  suite, so simply install that RPM first, or download the source
  from ftp://ftp.openssl.org and compile and install that.

    When compiling {UCD,Net}-SNMP from source, the configure script
  should detect that this library is not present, and use alternative
  arrangements for MD5-based authentication.

    If encryption (or SHA1-based authentication) is required, then
  this typically requires compiling from source.  Under Linux, both
  the 'openssl' and 'openssl-devel' RPMs should be installed, and the
  'config.cache' file removed before running "configure --with-openssl"
  and re-compiling.



I'm getting an error "autoheader: not found" - what's wrong?
-----------------------------------------------------------

    This usually appears when compiling the current development source
  version, obtained via CVS.  Unfortunately, the timestamps on some of
  the configure files are such that make assumes (mistakenly) that the
  configure script needs to be re-generated.
    A similar problem may arise relating to 'autoconf'.

    In both cases, this can be corrected by running the command
  "make -k touchit" before attempting to make the main package.



How can I reduce the memory footprint?
--------------------------------------

  In order to reduce the memory footprint (for instance, to
  embed the snmpd into a device), the following configure options
  could be used.

  '--disable-debugging'
     This turns off the compilation of all debugging statements.

  '--enable-mini-agent' '--with-out-mib-modules=examples/ucdDemoPublic'
     This creates an agent with just the essential MIB modules included.
     NOTE: If you need additional MIB modules, then simply add them
     using the option '--with-mib-modules=...' but this will of course
     increase the memory footprint.

  '--with-transports=UDP'
     This option specifies the transport domains to include.
     For a simple standalone agent, just UDP should be sufficient.
     (Although the 'disman' and 'agentx' modules may require the
      Callback, TCP and/or Unix transport domains as well).

   '--without-kmem-usage'
     This can be used in order to omit the code that operates on the
     /dev/kmem interface. Clearly, this option cannot be used when
     one of the configured MIB modules depends on it.

   '--with-mibdirs=' and '--with-mibs='
     These options tell the agent not to load any MIB modules. 
     This doesn't affect the size of libraries or application
     binaries, but will reduce the memory footprint during runtime.

   '--disable-mib-loading'
     This can be used in order to omit the code that loads and
     parses the MIB files altogether.  This will reduce both the
     runtime memory footprint, and the binary sizes.

  Once the agent (snmpd) has been linked, you might also try running
  'strip snmpd' to remove un-necessary debug/symbol information.



How can I reduce the installation footprint or speed up compilation?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you are using net-snmp v5.1 or above, then the following
  configure options may be useful to you:
                                                                                
  --disable-agent                 Do not build the agent (snmpd).
  --disable-applications          Do not build the apps (snmpget, ...).
  --disable-manuals               Do not install the manuals.
  --disable-scripts               Do not install the scripts (mib2c, ...).
  --disable-mibs                  Do not install the mib files.
  --disable-mib-loading            Do not include code that parses and
                                   manipulates the mib files.



How can I compile the project to use static linking?
---------------------------------------------------

  For totally static net-snmp executables, use
	configure --with-ldflags=-Bstatic

  To compile your application with static libraries (eg for easier
  debugging), and to link to a non-installed build directory, try the
  following Makefile fragment:
                                                                                
     NETSNMPDIR=/usr/local/build/snmp/full-clean-cvs-V5-1-patches
     NETSNMPCONFIG=$(NETSNMPDIR)/net-snmp-config

     NETSNMPBASECFLAGS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --base-cflags)
     NETSNMPINCLUDES := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --build-includes $(NETSNMPDIR))
     # base flags after build/src include, in case it has /usr/local/include
     NETSNMPCFLAGS=$(NETSNMPINCLUDES) $(NETSNMPBASECFLAGS)

     NETSNMPBASELIBS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --base-agent-libs)
     NETSNMPEXTLIBS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --external-agent-libs)
     NETSNMPLIBDIRS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --build-lib-dirs $(NETSNMPDIR))
     NETSNMPLIBDEPS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --build-lib-deps $(NETSNMPDIR))
     LIB_DEPS=$(NETSNMPLIBDEPS)
     LIBS=$(NETSNMPLIBDIRS) -Wl,-Bstatic $(NETSNMPBASELIBS) -Wl,-Bdynamic $(NETSNMPEXTLIBS)

     STRICT_FLAGS = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
     CFLAGS=-I. $(NETSNMPCFLAGS) $(STRICT_FLAGS)
                                                                                
  This replaces the standard Makefile section, which will used installed
  libraries:
                                                                                
     NETSNMPCONFIG=net-snmp-config
                                                                                
     # uncomment this if you have GNU make
     #NETSNMPCFLAGS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --base-cflags)
     #NETSNMPLIBS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --agent-libs)
     NETSNMPCFLAGS=`$(NETSNMPCONFIG) --base-cflags`
     NETSNMPLIBS=`$(NETSNMPCONFIG) --agent-libs`

     LIBS=$(NETSNMPLIBS)



Why is the project workspace empty under Visual C++?
---------------------------------------------------

    This is probably due to the different ways that Unix and Windows
  handle text file line termination.  Older versions of WinZip don't
  handle this properly, and Visual C++ gets confused (poor dear!).
  The latest version of WinZip is reported to unpack this correctly.



Why does 'make test' skip five tests?
-----------------------------------

    You mean T053agentv1trap, T054agentv2ctrap, T055agentv1mintrap,
  T056agentv2cmintrap and T113agentxtrap?

    These tests rely upon functionality in the NET-SNMP-EXAMPLES-MIB
  which is not implemented in the default agent configuration.  To
  include these tests, invoke the `configure` script to include
      '--with-mib-modules="examples/example".



Why does 'make test' complain about a pid file?
-----------------------------------------------

    Typically it says something like:

    cat:  cannot open /tmp/snmp-test-1-8694/*pid*

    It's trying to tell you the port is blocked - typically because
  another copy of the agent is still running, left over from from a
  previous testing run.

  If you type 'ps -ef' you should notice an orphaned process like:

  snmpd -d -r -U -P /tmp/snmp-test-5-27295/snmpd.pid...

  Kill this process.

  This could be happening for several reasons including:

    1.  You are trying to do concurrent runs of 'make test'.

    2.  On a slow machine, the agent might be taking too long to
      start up. Try changing the value of the variable SNMP_SLEEP
      in testing/RUNTESTS from 1 to something higher - say 3 or 5.



CODING
======

How do I write C code to integrate with the agent?
-------------------------------------------------

  At the moment, there are three methods for integrating external C code
  within the agent.

    The code can be included within the agent itself, statically configured
  and linked in when the agent is compiled.  Alternatively, with the 4.2
  release of the agent, it's possible to dynamically load MIB modules once
  the agent is running.  Finally, the agent can be configured to pass certain
  portions of the MIB tree off to one or more subagents.  See the earlier
  question on AgentX, SMUX and proxied SNMP for more details.

    All three mechanisms use the same module API.  This is described (in
  excruciating detail) in the file AGENT.txt, shipped with the standard
  distribution.  There is also an HTML version accessible via the project
  web page.  This task can be aided using the tool 'mib2c' which generates
  most of the necessary skeleton code from the description in the MIB file.

    Note that the UCD suite does not include support for SMUX subagents.



How does the agent fetch the value of a MIB variable from the system?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  This depends on the MIB variable (and the operating system).

    Much of the 'mib-2' information is extracted from kernel memory - 
  often by seeking to the appropriate location in the kernel itself and
  reading the data structures directly.

    Some systems provide cleaner interfaces to such kernel information
  (it would be hard to think of a less clean interface!), via ioctl()
  calls or similar system routines.  Such mechanisms are usually used
  in preference.

    Some other MIBs may be implemented completely within the agent
  itself, where the necessary information is already being held
  internally.  This particularly holds for MIBs relating to the
  operation of SNMP directly.  Other MIBs may involve communicating
  with another running process, or using a variety of other sources.

    There's no simple answer to this question, and obtaining the
  necessary information is often the hardest part of implementing
  a MIB.  Writing the code is straightforward by comparison!



Mib2c complains about a missing "mib reference" - what does this mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    This basically means that it hasn't loaded the MIB file containing
  the definition of the MIB subtree you're trying to implement.  This
  might be because it hasn't been installed, the name is wrong, or
  (most likely), because it isn't in the default list.  See the MIBS
  section for more details.



Mib2c complains about not having a "valid OID" - what does this mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    This probably means that you gave it the name of a MIB file (or
  module), rather than the name of an object defined in that file.
  Mib2c expects the name of a 'root' object, and will generate a
  template for the sub-tree starting from there.

    If you've got a file 'MY-MIB.txt', defining the MIB module
  'MY-MIB' which contains a subtree based on the object 'myMib',
  then you should invoke mib2c as
            "mib2c .... myMib"
  rather than
            "mib2c .... MY-MIB.txt"
  or        "mib2c .... MY-MIB"

    Note that you'll probably also have to add your MIB to the list of
  MIBs that are loaded automatically, in order for mib2c to recognise
  the name of this object.  So the command would typically be
            "MIBS=+MY-MIB mib2c .... myMib"
  or        "MIBS=ALL     mib2c .... myMib"



Why doesn't Mib2c like the MIB file I'm giving it?
-------------------------------------------------

    This is most likely the same problem as above.  Mib2c takes the
  name of a MIB object, not the name of a file (or a MIB module).
  Try using the name of the MODULE-IDENTITY definition.

    Another possibility is that the MIB may contain syntax errors.
  Try running it through 'snmptranslate' or a dedicated SMI
  validation tool (such as 'smilint' or the on-line interface at
  http://wwwsnmp.cs.utwente.nl/ietf/mibs/validate/)



Mib2c ignores my MIB and generates a pair of 'mib-2' code files.  Why?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is usually a sign of the same problem as above - giving
  mib2c the name of the file containing the MIB (or of the MIB
  itself), rather than an object within it.

  Earlier versions of mib2c didn't detect this situation, and
  rather than report an error, it merrily constructed a template
  for a default starting point of the mib-2 node.

  More recent versions issue the error mentioned above instead.



Mib2c complains about "configuration files". What's this for?
------------------------------------------------------------

    You've probably upgraded to the v5 net-snmp release (from the
  v4 ucd-snmp release).  This introduced a new approach to agent
  module development, including a number of different "helpers".
  The mib2c tool comes with configurations to generate code for
  many of these, but you'll need to select which is most convenient
  for your particular case.



Which mib2c configuration file should I use?
-------------------------------------------

    If the MIB contains scalar objects, then use the config file
  'mib2c.scalar.conf'.   This will generate template handlers for
  these scalar objects (ignoring internal structural definitions,
  table objects and notifications).

    If the MIB contains tables, then there are number of possible
  choices.  There are at least four configuration files that will
  generate template handlers for table objects (ignoring internal
  internal structural definitions, scalar objects and notifications).
  Which to use depends on the characteristics of the table being
  modelled (in particular where the data is held), and preferences
  as to the style of code structure.

    The config file 'mib2c.create-dataset.conf' assumes that the
  data is held internally within the agent, and generates a single
  handler routine for each table.  Most of the processing is handled
  internally within the agent, so this handler routine is really
  only needed if particular column objects require special processing.
  
    The config file 'mib2c.iterate.conf' is aimed at tables which
  model data held external to the agent (not necessarily ordered
  according to the MIB indexing requirements).  It generates a pair
  of "iteration" routines, which can be used to step through the
  table, to select the appropriate row for any given request.
  This row is then passed to the (single) table handler routine,
  which handles the rest of the processing for all of the column
  objects (for both GET and SET requests).

    There is also a similar 'mib2c.iterate_access.conf' which
  builds on this, but generates a series of individual routines
  for handling GET or SET requests for each column object.

    The config file 'mib2c.array-user.conf' is again primarily
  aimed at data held within the agent (although it can also be used
  with external data).  In contrast to the single handler routine of
  the first two approaches, this generates a series of separate
  template routines to handle different aspects of processing the
  request.  As with the 'mib2c.create-dataset.conf' approach, much
  of the processing is handled internally.  Many of the generated
  routines can be deleted if the relevant objects need no special
  processing.
 
    The most recent 'mfd' (or 'MIBs For Dummies') configuration takes
  this idea of small (often optional) 'stub' routines even further.
  This generates a collection of separate *files*, each of which
  implements a particular aspect of the table processing.  The idea
  here is to have lots of "baby steps", rather than have all the
  processing dealt with in one place.

    There are also some other 'mib2c' configuration files, for more
  specialised requirements (e.g. generating notifications, "watched"
  scalar objects, or code that is compatible with the v4 UCD agent
  API), but these are the main choices for most requirements.



How can I have Mib2c generate code for both scalars and tables?
--------------------------------------------------------------

    The v5 Net-SNMP mib2c tool uses separate configuration files to
  generate code for scalar objects, and for tables.  This means that
  it's not possible to automatically generate a single code file
  that supports both scalars and tables.

    Instead, it's necessary to generate the two code files separately,
  and then combine the two files manually.  The handler routines from
  one file can simply be included in the other with no changes needed.
  The corresponding registration of these handlers can then be copied
  from the first initialisation routine into the second.



Are there any examples, or documentation?
-------------------------------------------

    Most of the MIB modules shipped with the Net-SNMP agent still
  use the v4 "traditional" MIB module API, but a few use one of the
  newer v5 helper-based handlers.

    The dataset handler is used in the two DISMAN-EVENT-MIB modules
  (disman/mteEventTable and disman/mteEventNotificationTable), as
  well as the 'snmptrapd' implementation of logging incoming traps
  (apps/notification_log)

    The basic iterator handler is used in a number of modules, such
  as the latest TCP and UDP table implementations (mibII/tcpTable &
  mibII/udpTable), VACM context handling (mibII/vacm_context) and
  various tables relating to agent internals (agent/*).  These show
  a number of different approaches to using the iterator helper, so
  it's worth comparing them.

    The two examples/netSnmpHostsTable* modules provide a contrast
  between the iterator and iterator_access helpers.

    The Net-SNMP agent does not currently include any MIB modules
  using the array-user container-based helper.  The best examples
  of this are to be found in the net-policy project.
  See http://net-policy.sourceforge.net/



Where should I put the files produced by 'mib2c'?
------------------------------------------------

  If you're using the main source tree to compile your new module, then
  put these two files (mymib.[ch]) in the directory 'agent/mibgroup'.
  You should then re-run configure to add in your new module
  ("configure --with-mib-modules=mymib") and recompile.

    If you've got a number of new modules to add, it might be
  sensible to put them all into a single subdirectory of 'mibgroup'.
  Then create a header file, listing the individual components.
  This might look something like:

		config_require(mymib/myObjects)
		config_require(mymib/myTable)
		config_require(mymib/myOtherTable)

  If this was saved as the file 'mymib.h', then the same configure
  line given above, would pull in all three modules.  See the
  current contents of 'agent/mibgroup' for examples of this.



I've created a new module with 'mib2c' but it doesn't work.  Why not?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember that 'mib2c' generates a template for the MIB implementation.
  It doesn't fill in all the details for you.  In particular, it cannot
  know how to obtain the information needed to answer particular queries.
  That's the job of the MIB module programmer (you!) -  See the previous
  question for how to proceed.

    Essentially mib2c handles the syntax of the MIB implementation,
  leaving you to concentrate on the semantics.



I've added my code to this template and it still doesn't work.  Why not?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's difficult to provide a definitive answer to that.  The
  best we can do is suggest a checklist that might help pinpoint
  the source of the problem.  Try looking at the following:

    - Is the new module being compiled?
        (Delete any .o files, and re-run 'make'
         Are the .o files re-created?)

    - Is it being included in the agent library?
        (Run 'nm' on the library and look for the names
         of the initialisation routine and variable handlers)

    - Is the initialisation routine being run?
        (Activate the debugging code that you put into
         this routine.  You *do* include debugging code 
         as a matter of course, don't you?)

    - Has the module been registered with the agent?
        (Try walking the NET-SNMP-MIB::nsModuleTable)
        This will also check whether the agent accepts
        requests for enterprise-specific OIDs.

    - Is the module handler actually being called at all?
        (Activate the debugging code that you put into this
         handler, and do a single 'snmpget' or 'snmpgetnext'
         for a suitable instance.  You *do* include debugging
         code as a matter of course, don't you?)

    - Is it returning success or an error?
        (Activate the debugging code.... but you get the idea!)

  That won't actually solve the problem, but at least you'll
  have some idea where to look.



Mib2c only handles a single table in my MIB. How can I fix this?
---------------------------------------------------------------

    This was a bug in the mib2c script, which was corrected with
  the 4.2 release.  Earlier versions can be fixed by applying the
  following patch:

	$ diff -u mib2c.cln mib2c
	--- mib2c.cln   Wed Nov 29 15:12:47 2000
	+++ mib2c       Wed Nov 29 15:13:18 2000
	@@ -132,6 +132,6 @@
	 #============================================
	 foreach $vtable (@table_list) {
	     foreach $ptable (@processtable) {
	-       $variables{$ptable}{'processed'} = 
	+       $variables{$ptable}{'processed'} .= 
	            (eval "\"$variables{$ptable}{'code'}\"") . "\n\n";
	     }



Why does the iterator call my get_{first,next} routines so often?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The first thing to realise is that the 'get_first' and 'get_next'
  hook routines are concerned with processing a single request, not
  with walking the whole table.  A full "snmpwalk" command will typically
  involve a series of individual 'GetNext' requests, and every one of
  these will trigger a separate 'get_first/get_next/get_next/....' cycle.

    It's usually more efficient to use 'snmptable' which will walk
  each column in parallel (as well as displaying the results in a
  more natural manner).

    Secondly, the iterator helper was originally designed to handle
  unsorted data, so will look at every row of the internal table for
  each request.  If the data is actually held in the correct order,
  then it's worth setting the NETSNMP_ITERATOR_FLAG_SORTED flag:
      iinfo = SNMP_MALLOC_TYPEDEF(netsnmp_iterator_info);
      iinfo->flags |= NETSNMP_ITERATOR_FLAG_SORTED;
  This will help the situation somewhat.

    But the iterator helper is inherently a relatively inefficient
  mechanism, and it may be worth looking at one of the other helpers,
  particularly if the data will be held within the agent itself.



How can I support a large table, with more than 256 column objects?
------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is a problem (at least apparently) with the v4 UCD module
  API, which uses a "magic number" to distinguish between the various
  column objects implemented by a common variable handling routine.
  Since this field is defined as an unsigned character, it can only
  take values 0-255.   So at first sight, it would appear that the
  agent cannot support tables (or scalar groups) with more than 256
  objects, since this would start to duplicate these magic numbers.

    However, the agent doesn't actually care which routine implements
  a given object, and magic numbers only need to be unique within a
  single variable handling routine.  So it is actually perfectly
  possible to implement a larger table by splitting it between two
  (or more) variable handling routines.  These can then re-use the
  magic numbers quite safely:

    struct variable1 [] = {
       {MAGIC1,   ASN_INTEGER, RWRITE, var_myfirst,  1, {  1}},
       {MAGIC2,   ASN_INTEGER, RWRITE, var_myfirst,  1, {  2}},
    		:
       {MAGIC255, ASN_INTEGER, RWRITE, var_myfirst,  1, {255}},
       {MAGIC1,   ASN_INTEGER, RWRITE, var_mysecond, 1, {256}},
       {MAGIC2,   ASN_INTEGER, RWRITE, var_mysecond, 1, {257}},
    		:
       {MAGIC255, ASN_INTEGER, RWRITE, var_mysecond, 1, {510}}
    };

  All that matters is that a given magic number isn't re-used within
  the same variable handling routine.  The v5 table handlers typically
  use an integer variable for holding column information, so aren't
  subject to the same limitations.

    Though I'd have to question whether having such a wide table is
  necessarily a particularly good design strategy!



How can I get the agent to generate a trap (or inform)?
------------------------------------------------------

    Generating a trap is reasonably simple - just call one of the
  trap API routines 'send_easy_trap()' or 'send_v2trap' with the
  relevant information (generic and specific trap values, or a
  varbind list respectively).  See the 'snmp_trap_api(3)' man page
  for details.

    The 'mib2c.notify.conf' configuration file can be used to
  construct a suitable template routine for generating a trap,
  including building the variable list from the MIB trap
  definition.  These variables can then be given suitable values,
  before invoking the 'send_v2trap' call to actually send the trap.

    Note that these APIs are only available within the agent (or
  subagents), and are not available to stand-alone applications.
  The code for 'snmptrap' shows an approach to use in such a case.

    Determining _when_ to generate the trap (either directly or
  via the mib2c-generated routine) is often harder.  If the trap
  is generated in response to some action within the agent, (e.g.
  as the result of a SET), then this isn't too much of a problem.

    But if the trap is intended to report on a change of status
  (e.g. a network interface going up or down, or a disk filling up),
  then actually detecting this is non-trivial.   It's necessary to
  poll the value(s) on a regular basis, save the results and compare
  them with the new values the next time round.

    With the v4 UCD agent, this would have to be done manually,
  using the routines documented in 'snmp_alarm(3)'.  The v5 Net-SNMP
  agent has implemented the Distributed Management Event MIB, which
  provides this functionality in a flexible, standardised manner.
  See the 'snmpd.conf(5)' man page (under DISMAN-EVENT-MIB) for
  details (including the need for an 'agentSecName' setting).



How can I get the agent to send an SNMPv1 (or SNMPv2c) trap?
-----------------------------------------------------------

    It doesn't make any difference whether you use the v1-style
  API call 'send_easy_trap' or the v2-style 'send_v2trap' - what
  matters is the directive(s) in the snmpd.conf file.

    If this file contains 'trapsink', then the agent will send
  an SNMPv1 trap.  If this file contains 'trap2sink', then the
  agent will send an SNMPv2c trap.  And if this file contains
  both, then the agent will send *two* copies of this trap.



How can I get the agent to include varbinds with an SNMPv1 trap?
---------------------------------------------------------------

    There are two ways to do this.  You can either use the
  'send_v2trap' call and give a varbind list, starting with
  the v2-equivalent of the SNMPv1 trap, followed by the
  additional varbinds.

    Alternatively, you can use the API call 'send_trap_vars'
  which takes the same generic/specific trap values as
  'send_easy_trap', plus the list of additional varbinds.

    In either case, you also need to have 'trapsink' in the
  snmpd.conf file.  The resulting trap will be identical,
  whichever approach is used.



How can I get the agent to send an SNMPv1 enterprise-specific trap?
------------------------------------------------------------------

    There are two ways to do this.  You can either use the
  'send_v2trap' call and give a varbind list, starting with
  the v2-equivalent of the SNMPv1 trap, followed by the
  additional varbinds.

    Alternatively, you can use the (undocumented) API call
  'send_enterprise_trap_vars' which takes the same parameters
  as 'send_trap_vars', plus the enterprise OID to use (in the
  usual name/length form).  See the code file 'agent_trap.c'

    In either case, you also need to have 'trapsink' in the
  snmpd.conf file.  The resulting trap will be identical,
  whichever approach is used.



How can I get the agent to send an SNMPv3 trap (or inform)?
----------------------------------------------------------

    It doesn't matter which API call you use to specify the
  trap - 'send_easy_trap', 'send_v2trap' or one of the other
  calls mentioned above.  Generating an SNMPv3 notification
  (rather than a community-based one) is controlled by the
  snmpd.conf file.
  
    To send an SNMPv3 trap, this file should contain a
  'snmpsess' directive, specifying the version, security
  level, user name and passphrases (if applicable), as
  well as the destination address.  This is basically
  the same as the command line required for sending the
  trap manually, using 'snmptrap'.

    Note that (unlike 'snmptrap') this directive does *not*
  read default settings from an 'snmp.conf' file, so these
  must be specified explicitly in the 'snmpsess' line.



Why does calling 'send_v2trap' generate an SNMPv1 trap (or vice versa)?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The two versions of the trap API calls are concerned with how
  the trap is represented when it is passed *in* to the API, not
  the version of the trap PDU that will actually be generated by
  the agent.  That is determined by the configuration token used
  to set up the trap destination.

    Remember that in general, all traps are sent to all destinations.
  This means that a trap specified using the SNMPv1 trap syntax
  needs to be converted to the SNMPv2 format before it can be sent
  to an SNMPv2 (or SNMPv3) destination.  Similarly, a trap specified
  using the SNMPv2 syntax needs to be converted to the SNMPv1 format
  before it can be sent to an SNMPv1 sink.

    Essentially, the API call to use depends on what you asking for,
  which is not necessarily what the recipients will actually get!
  See 'snmp_trap_api(3)' for a fuller explanation.



What if I'm using an AgentX sub-agent instead?
---------------------------------------------

    That doesn't matter - the routines described in 'snmp_trap_api(3)'
  can still be used, and the subagent will do the Right Thing.
  
  One of the original design aims of the AgentX support was that this
  should be transparent to a MIB module implementer.  The agent-module
  interface should be independent of the protocol used to receive the
  original request.  So the exact same MIB module code could be used
  within a traditional SNMP-only agent, or an AgentX subagent, with no
  changes needed.
    In fact, the main agent supplied as part of the package can indeed
  be run as an SNMP agent or an AgentX subagent, simply based on command
  line flags (or similar configuration options).



How can I register a MIB module in a different (SNMPv3) context?
---------------------------------------------------------------

    Contexts are a mechanism within SNMPv3 (and AgentX) whereby
  an agent can support parallel versions of the same MIB objects,
  referring to different underlying data sets.  By default, a MIB
  module registrations will use the default empty context of "".
  But it's also possible to explicitly register an individual MIB
  module using a different context.

    With the v4 API, this uses the call 'register_mib_context()'
  rather than the REGISTER_MIB macro.  This is significantly more
  detailed, but most of the additional parameters can take fixed
  values, if all that's needed is to change the registration context.

  Instead of the macro call:
        REGISTER_MIB("my_token", my_variables, variable1, my_variables_oid);
  use the function call:
        register_mib_context( "my_token",
                               my_variables, sizeof(variable1),
                               sizeof(my_variables)/sizeof(variable1),
                               my_variables_oid,
                               sizeof(my_variables_oid)/sizeof(oid),
                               DEFAULT_MIB_PRIORITY, 0, 0, NULL,
                               "my_context", -1, 0);

    Things are much easier with the v5 helper-based API.  Having
  created the registration structure, this just requires setting the
  'contextName' field before actually registering the MIB module:
        netsnmp_handler_registration *reg;
        reg = netsnmp_create_handler_registration(.....);
        reg->contextName = strdup("my_context");
        netsnmp_register_handler(reg);

    In either case, it will also be necessary to define suitable
  access control entries to cover requests using the new context.
  This can either list each context explicitly:

	access {group} "my_context" any noauth exact  ......

  or use a single entry to cover all possible contexts:

	access {group} ""           any noauth prefix ......

  But note that *both* steps are required.  Changing the access
  control settings won't affect the default context used for MIB
  registrations, and registering a MIB in a non-default context
  won't automatically configure the necessary access control settings.



MISC
======

Why are packets requesting the same information larger with UC-Davis SNMP?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This shouldn't happen with version 4.2 or later, but for older
  version the following still applies:

    Some users note that UCD-SNMP applications always generate larger PDUs
  than other SNMP packages, even if the information requested is the same.
  Further, there are some agents that refuse PDUs from UCD-SNMP applications
  but accept PDUs from other applications.

  UCD-SNMP is based on the CMU code from a long time ago which encoded things
  using the long form of length encoding.  Some agents use the short form
  of length encoding only, and do not understand the long form.

    This should not be a problem with UCD v4.2 or higher, or the Net-SNMP
  releases.



What ASN.1 parser is used?
-------------------------

  The parser used by both the agent and client programs is coded by hand.
  This parser has recently been re-vamped to allow control of which of 
  the available MIBs should be included, and to handle duplicate object
  subidentifiers.
    The source code can be found in the snmplib directory (in 'parse.c'),
  and the parser is usually bundled into the library 'libsnmp.a'

    Note that the parser attempts to be fairly forgiving of some common
  errors and incompatibilities in MIB files.  The Net-SNMP tools accepting
  a MIB file without complaint does *not* imply that the MIB is strictly
  correct.
    Certain MIBs may need some amendments to allow them to be read
  correctly by the parser.  Contact the coders' list for advice.



What is the Official Slogan of the net-snmp-coders list?
