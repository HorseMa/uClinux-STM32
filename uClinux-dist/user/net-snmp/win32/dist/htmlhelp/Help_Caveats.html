<h1>Help Caveats</h1>
<br>
There are a few anomalies in the help files for Net-SNMP that deserve
your attention.<br>
<h2>1. Volunteers are welcomed</h2>
Please understand that this is a volunteer effort.  Suggestions
are welcomed.  Offers to contribute are encouraged.<br>
<br>
<h2>2. Documentation format is mostly fixed width<br>
</h2>
The documentation is set for fixed width text. Changing this would be
time consuming and would have to be re-done for each release if the
original man pages change.&nbsp; See the note on offers to contribute.<br>
<br>
<h2>3. Conventions may be different from what you are used to</h2>
The Net-SNMP project is subject to conventions that may conflict with
what you may have been comfortably using.&nbsp; If you are not aware of
these conventions, there will be hours of entertainment in store for
you.&nbsp; Please know that the Net-SNMP coders are sympathetic to
different conventions, but as conventions go, these are not too
distasteful.<br>
<br>
CLI = MS-DOS command line interpreter.&nbsp; When you open a command
prompt window, you are using the CLI.<br>
<br>
SH = UNIX command shell.&nbsp; May be sh, bash, ksh, csh, all are
variations on the UNIX command shell.<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>If you use .BAT files, follow the MS-DOS conventions.</li>
  <li>If you use GNU shell, follow the UNIX conventions.</li>
  <li>If you don't know what you are using, follow the MS-DOS
conventions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.1&nbsp; Environment variables</h3>
MS-DOS convention used in CLI as would be used in a batch file:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; font-family: monospace;">
  <li>create&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set
MYVAR=myvalue</li>
  <li>use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %MYVAR%</li>
  <li>view&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo %MYVAR%</li>
  <li>destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set MYVAR=</li>
  <li>%MYVAR% and %MyVar% are the same</li>
  <li>values with embedded spaces must be bracketed using double quotes.</li>
</ol>
UNIX convention used in SH as would be used in a shell script:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; font-family: monospace;">
  <li>create&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MYVAR=myvalue ; export MYVAR</li>
  <li>use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $MYVAR</li>
  <li>view&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo $MYVAR</li>
  <li>destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unset MYVAR</li>
  <li>$MYVAR and $MyVar are _not_ the same!</li>
  <li>values with embedded spaces must be bracketed using double quotes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2&nbsp; Pathname specifiers</h3>
MS-DOS convention used in CLI as would be used in a batch file:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>volume names (drive letters) [A-Z] followed by colon ":" are
acceptable.</li>
  <li>Directory segments are separated using the backslash "\"</li>
  <li>UNC components of pathnames may work</li>
</ol>
UNIX convention used in SH as would be used in a shell script or in a
configuration file:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>volume names [A-Z] followed by colon ":" are acceptable.</li>
  <li>Directory segments are separated using the slash "/"</li>
  <li>UNC components of pathnames do _not_ work!</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:&nbsp; All paths contained in
configuration files must use forward slashes (Unix convention), NOT
back slashes.</span><br>
<h3>3.3&nbsp; List delimiters</h3>
MS-DOS convention used in CLI as would be used in a batch file:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>Elements are separated using the semi-colon ";".</li>
  <li>The last element must not be empty [list does not end with ";"].</li>
</ol>
<br>
The UNIX convention is not listed, because the Net-SNMP project, when
it is built on Windows platforms, honors the MS-DOS convention for
lists.<br>
<br>
<h2>4. Pathnames are different than they appear to be</h2>
The manual pages were written over a period of years and for systems
that were primarily UNIX-based.&nbsp; The pathnames are not absolutely
the same as what you see in the documentation.<br>
<br>
You can pretty much see that many paths start with "/usr/local".&nbsp;
For this platform, most of the time, you can substitute the instllation
folder of Net-SNMP for "/usr/local".&nbsp; For example, c:\usr or
c:\Program Files\Net-SNMP.<br>
<br>
<h2>5. Configuration Files</h2>
All the configuration files follow the UNIX conventions for pathnames
and the MS-DOS convention for list delimiters.<br>
