There are several tasks that are pending to be done, I have classified them
by dificulty levels:

= Relatively easy =
 * add syslog support (based on Simon Lodal's patch)
 * improve shell scripts for keepalived/heartbeat: *really* important
 * use NACK based protocol, feedback: call pablo :-)
 * manpage for conntrackd(8)
 * use the floating priority feature in keepalived to avoid premature
   take over.

= Requires some work =
 * study better keepalived transitions
 * test/fix ipv6 support
 * have a look at open issues
 * implement support for TCP window tracking (patches are on the table) at 
   the moment you have to disable it:

  	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal

= Requires kernel patches =
 * setup master conntrack to match IPCT_RELATED

= Open issues =
 * unsupported iptables matches:
   * connbytes: probably the persistent may support it
   * recent: requires further study
   * quota: private data counters
 * connection tracking NAT helpers: sequence adjustment issues (?)
