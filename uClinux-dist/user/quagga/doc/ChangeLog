	* routeserver.texi: Strip ctrl-M from line endings, note by
	  sigma@smx.pair.com

          texinfo to build, until such time as texinfo 4.7 is more
          prevalent.

2004-11-08 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: Add routeserver.texi to quagga_TEXINFOS.
	  Add quagga.info to clean files list (would have thought automake
          would have done this, but it doesnt seem to)

2004-11-07 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* quagga.texi: include routeserver.texi. TODO: integrate the current
          multiple-instance orientated bgpd route-server section with the

2004-11-07 Paul Jakma <paul@dishone.st>

	* Makefile.am: Add automatic rule to build pdf's from eps figures.
	  Clean *.pdf. Add rule for quagga.pdf (as the eps.pdf pattern
          probably otherwise will override automake's rule for quagga.pdf)

	  is proper. Strip trailling space from the main menu lines.

          autoconf substitution is available. Define common AUTHORS,
          COPYRIGHT_YEAR and COPYRIGHT_STR vars.
	* (global): Make use of makeinfo node pointer auto-creation
          to avoid having to fully specify links for nodes, so we only have
          to specify current node name - simplifies text slightly.
          Remove extraneous newlines which appear to cause extra blank pages
          to be added in output.
          Update copyright strings which appear in various places to
          use the new COPYRIGHT_STR texinfo variable.
	  Change url to uref, the former need not output an actual
	  hyperlink depending on version of texinfo, the latter should if
	  supported by the format (eg PDF).
	* texinfo.tex: Update to a more recent version. previous file
	  was many many years old. This file should possibly be removed
          altogether, and allowed to be installed by automake.
        * quagga.texi: Make use of automake's version.texi feature to
          have VERSION and some other vars auto-defined. include
          defines.texi. Change copyright strings to use the COPYRIGHT_STR
          variable.
	* install.texi: Make the privs section an actual section. Ditto for
	  the Linux notes.
	* overview.texi: Supply URL for Quagga, where format allows. Tidy up
          one or two paragraphs slightly.
	  Update the section on supported platforms.
	  Remove the ZNOG list stuff, direct reader to the website for
          further information on email lists.
	* vtysh.texi: Update the integrated config file section. Make the
	  commands sections so correct PDF indexes are built.
