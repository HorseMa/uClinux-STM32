	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): New - just has EXTRA_DIST.  (Using a
	directory in EXTRA_DIST in the parent was causing 'make dist' to fail.)

	* *.m4: import of libtool CVS m4 autoconf files. These only
	  configure libtool support for languages where configure has
	  already called AC_PROG_<lang>, less fragile.
	* README.txt: doc file for contents of this directory.
