  This is a preliminary test repository, to ensure that we have
a collection of tests which work, and which may be used to debug/verify
the functionality of the server.

  There is no test harness yet, but the tests should be of the format:

#U  -- entry to go in 'users' file'
attributes...
#R  -- data received in the 'reply'
