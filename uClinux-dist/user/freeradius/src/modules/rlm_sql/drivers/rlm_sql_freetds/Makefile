#  The FreeTDS libraries are still in development, and the API to use
#  them has not been finalized.  As a result, if you want to use this
#  module, you MUST edit the source, and update the rest of this
#  file by hand.
#
#  Please do NOT ask questions about the FreeTDS libraries or API's
#  on the FreeRADIUS list.  No one there can answer your questions.
#  Instead, ask questions on the FreeTDS mailing list.
