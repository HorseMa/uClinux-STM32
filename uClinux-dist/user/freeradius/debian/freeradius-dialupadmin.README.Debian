Dialup Admin Debian README
Configuration is in /etc/freeradius-dialupadmin/
which is linked into the dialupadmin tree in
/usr/share/freeradius-dialupadmin.

To put this into production, set a path on your
webserver to point to
/usr/share/freeradius-dialupadmin/htdocs
and ensure .php3 is processed by PHP.

The scripts make use of .. to access the
other paths, so symlinking into your webtree
may not work.
