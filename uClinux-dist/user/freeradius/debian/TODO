* Begin writing manpages for topics listed in the
  debian/freeradius.undocumented file.

09 July 2003 -- Paul Hampson
* Debhelper usage check/best practice audit
  (http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/debian-devel-announce-200303/msg00002.html)
* See if it builds cleanly on Debian/stable.
