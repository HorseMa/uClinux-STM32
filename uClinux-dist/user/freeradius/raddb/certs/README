This directory contains a number of sample certificates for
use by the rlm_eap_tls module.  These certificates should be used
ONLY for testing purposes.

If you're not using EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, or EAP-PEAP, then you may delete
this entire directory.

If you are using one or more of those authentication protocols, then
the certificates included here should be replaced with ones signed
by a real Certificate Authority.
