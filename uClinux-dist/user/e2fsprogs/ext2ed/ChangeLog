	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.36

2004-04-03  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ext2ed.h: Use the ext2_fs.h header file from libext2fs, instead
		from the kernel header files.

	* Makefile.in: Update the modtime even if subst doesn't need to
		update the ext2ed man page and conbfiguration, to avoid
		always re-running subst, especially since there are no
		dependencies on these generated files.

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.30

2002-09-30  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* dir_com.c (search_dir_entries): If there is a directory entry of
		length 0, go to the next block, so we don't end up looping
		forever.

2001-09-24  Theodore Tso  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.29

2001-08-31  Theodore Tso  <tytso@thunk.org>

	* Release of E2fsprogs 1.28

2002-05-12    <tytso@mit.edu>

	* README: Add warning about shortcomings in ext2ed.  Please don't
		include this in distributions --- it's too buggy for that.

	* init.c (signal_SIGWINCH_handler): Reinstall signal handler after
		it is activated.

	* main.c: Make use of readline library optional (currently
		disabled).  Allow the filesystem/device which is to be
		examined/edited to be specified on the command line, with
		the -w option indicating that the filesystem should be
		opened read/write.  Use the ncurses functions to read from
		the keyboard, and use the pgdn and pgup keys to activate
		the relavant commands.  Also poll the keyboard with a
		timeout of .1 second, so that window-size changes can be
		dealt with automatically.

	* Makefile.in: Remove ncurses library from link line.

	* win.c: Rewrite redraw function so that it changes the all of the
		ncurses's windows, instead of destroying all of the
		windows and recreating them all.  (This assumes requires
		some ncurses-specific functions, and isn't quite as
		portable, but that's OK.)  Create two new windows and
		force the lines above and below the showpad area to be
		empty.

	* general_com.c: Remove e-mail address for Gadi Oxman, since it
		doesn't work anymore, and I've made enough changes that
		Gadi shouldn't get any complaints or bug reports for this
		version.
	
2002-05-11    <tytso@mit.edu>

	* win.c, main.c, general_com.c: Use e2fsprogs's version
		information for the program banner.

	* ext2ed.h, init.c, general_com.c: Add a field_type parameter, and
		use specialized routines for showing and setting ints, uints,
		and characeter strings.

	* ext2.descriptors: Updated with newer superblock descriptor; use
		__u32 and __u16 instead of unsigned long and unsigned
		short.  Add data structures for direcctory indexing code.

	* Makefile.in: Added make depend logic.

2002-05-11    <tytso@mit.edu>

	* ext2ed.h: Remove VAR_DIR, and replace it with ETC_DIR.
		(/var/lib is no longer a politically correct location for
		application files according to the FHS).  Change include
		file location of ncurses.h to be /usr/include/ncurses.h.

	* init.c: Look for the configuration file in ETC_DIR/ext2ed.conf

	* Makefile.in: Integrate into the e2fsprogs makefile structure

	* ext2ed.conf.in, ext2ed.8.in: Change to be generated files, so
		that the pathnames in the man page and config file match
		the values chosen by the configure script.
