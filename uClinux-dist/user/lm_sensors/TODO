I2C CODE CHANGES
================

See TODO in the i2c package.


KERNEL MODULES
==============

* Harmonize 'smart fan' support.
  The following drivers support pwm. The ones that support
  automatic or smart fan support are identified.
  We have a /proc standard for manual PWM support that allows
  for /proc based applications like pwmconfig and fancontrol
  in our package.
  Without a /proc standard for smart fan support such applications
  are much more difficult.

	Driver		Manual PWM	Smart fan
	adm1026		standard	not supported
	asb100		standard	??
	it87		non-std		yes
	lm85		standard	yes
	vt1211		doesn't work	not supported
	w83627hf	standard        not supported
	w83781d		standard	not supported (791 only)

  The following drivers are for chips that have manual PWM only.

	Driver		Manual PWM
	mtp008		standard
	smsc47m1	standard
	vt8231		standard
	w83781d (except 791d)	standard

* Assistance on how to fix module refcounting is welcome.
  To my understanding, it does not handle client->adapter->owner
  correctly now, and it is possible to rmmod adapter while one of its
  clients is in use.

* "uninstall" Makefile target.

* mkpatch. Trace back Configure changes from 2.5 tree and
  have it make clean diffs.
  Applies to both i2c and sensors.

* ACPI and SMBus host
 - ACPI subsystem may access SMBus host too. Locks?
 - On my ancient board using i2c-via, suspend and power switch status
   seems to be in the same register with SCL and SDA.

* Suspend-to-disk, losing Vcc
 - Reset i2c client to avoid alarms and SCI interrupts. Currently
   sensors do not create interrupt with alarms.

* Return from suspend
 - Reinitialize i2c client.

* Handle -1 returns from i2c layer rather than just delivering 0xFF to
  /proc and libsensors; report errors through /proc 'alarms' or
  new 'fail' entry? See adm1021 for a partial example.

* Add string function in sensors.o
* ALL: cleanup_module is void; check also that cleaning up is done
  properly, now we know that the module will be unloaded whatever we
  do.
* ALL chip drivers: add a readonly insmod option so we don't cause APM/ACPI
  to go insane.
* gl518sm: using iterate==2 causes a tread to be started. this thread remains
  even after setting iterate==1 and/or removing the gl518sm module
  <koenig@uranus.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>
* LM78 detection: Tom Webster has proven that the reset bit in the 
  id register can be one (strange!)
* maxilife.c: Introduce new insmod variables
* maxilife.c: Round REG_TO_VID correctly
* icspll.c: Rewrite. The current implementation simply can't work at all.
  It needs i2c-level access (too bad for SMBus-only adapters).
* w83781d: Some features are still unsupported for the W8378[23].
  Also, alarms seem to give strange results
  sometimes, and there are some other minor problems, as indicated by
  Jonathan Bradshaw <jonathan@NrgUp.Com>
* Support 10-bit addresses. At this moment, they are supported nowhere, except
  in Simon Vogl's i2c modules.
* Better general locking, or at least a once-over to check no race-conditions
  remain. This is part of the SMP-safeness, and can better be done at once.
* adm9240: check whether the current voltage computations are correct.
  Probably not, as they are different from the datasheet specifications.
  Also check for the supported dallas chip.
* lm80: Check how OS alarms work. At page 17 of the sheet, it tells
  something completely different from the description at page 25.
* gl518sm: Assume that new values are close to old values, so start with
  trying to use a small range near the old values (already partially done)
* Add MTP006F chip: http://www.myson.com/Pcd/MTP006/Mtp006.pdf
  gfiala@s.netic.de (Guido Fiala) has one on his mainboard


LIBRARY
=======

* Easier use of /proc and libsensors without knowing the chip type
  At the moment a programmer wishing to use the lm_sensors package needs to know
  what chips are supported and needs to add all those chips into his package.
  If you were to add a field or function to your structures to the effect of
  sensor-function a programmer could use the package a lot more simply.
  For values you could do something like -
    enum sensor-type { volt, fan, temp, volt_min, volt_max, fan_div, fan_min,
    temp_over, temp_hyst }

* reload does not work (Bison/Flex problem?).
* Some library routines are pretty inefficient right now.
* Library should be split in more separate files, for better linking
  behaviour.
* Some adm9240 labels start with a digit; change this, it leads to confusing
  syntax in the conf file (they have to be quoted)


PROGRAMS
========

* Sensors program needs to print a + before lm75 temperatures


OTHERS
======

* Examine watchdog-4.3 or later of meskes@debian.org (Michael Meskes)
  tsx-11.mit.edu /pub/linux/sources/sbin or 
  sunsite.unc.edu /pub/linux/system/daemons/watchdog
