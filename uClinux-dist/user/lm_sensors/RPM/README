Use lm_sensors-rh.spec to build against stock kernels of RedHat based
distributions.
Use lm_sesnosrs.spec to build against custom built kernels.

Short instructions on how to build:

1) Put lm_sesnosrs.spec into SPECS directory of your rpm tree
(/usr/src/redhat/SPECS on RedHat, /usr/src/packages/SPECS on SuSe,
/usr/src/RPM/SPECS on Mandrake).

2) Put lm_sensors tarball in the SOURCES directory of your RPM tree (see
   examples above).

3) Adjust the following variables in lm_sesnosrs.spec:
 a) prefix - where the stuff gets installed;
 b) kversion - kernel version you are running;
 c) mversion (if necessary) - defines path for modules' install (equal to
    kversion by default) -- modules will be installed to /lib/modules/%{mversion}. 
 d) ver - version of lm_sensors you are compiling (if necessary);
 e) Group - to which groups the packages belong  (if necessary).
 f) If i2c has been installed into a location defferent form prefix or /usr,
    you must ajust I2C_HEADERS as well.
 
4) Type `rpm -bb lm_sensors.spec' from the SPECS directory.
5) Install the resulting binary packages.

To build this rpm you need (apart from the rpm program):
1) C development environment;
2) kernel sources and headers for the same version of kernel that you are
   running on your machine;
3) new i2c code installed -- if you are not running the latest 2.3.x kernels, 
   get and install the new i2c code from http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78/.

This SPEC file will build the following binary packages:

 lm_sensors -- user space stuff
 lm_sensors-devel -- user space stuff for the application development
 lm_sensors-drivers -- kernel space drivers.

Dependencies: lm_sensors requires lm_sensors_drivers
			  lm_sensors-devel requires lm_sensors
			  lm_sensors-drivers requires new i2c code

lm_sensors and lm_sensors-devel can be distributed easily as binary
packages. They will be compatible with different configurations.

WARNING!!! lm_sensors-drivers must be compiled for the the same kernel
that will run on the target machine. This implies the same kernel
version and the  same kernel configuration. Thus, this binary packages
can be provided by distribution vendors only for their stock distribution
kernels. If you use a custom configured kernel, you must rebuild this
package. To protect the ignorant, we define kversion and make the
resulting package dependable on the specific version of the kernel.
