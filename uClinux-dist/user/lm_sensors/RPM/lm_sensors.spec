##This source RPM build the foloowing binary packages:
## lm_sensors -- user space stuff
## lm_sensors-devel -- user space stuff for the application development
## lm_sensors-drivers -- kernel space drivers.

##Dependencies: lm_sensors requires lm_sensors_drivers
##              lm_sensors-devel requires lm_sensors
##              lm_sensors-drivers requires new i2c code

## lm_sensors and lm_sensors-devel can be distributed easily as binary
## packages. They will be compatible with different configurations.

## WARNING!!! lm_sensors-drivers must be compiled for the the same kernel
## that will run on the target machine. This implies the same kernel
## version and the  same kernel configuration. Thus, this binary package
## can be provided by distribution vendors only for their stock distribution
## kernels. If you use a custom configured kernel, you must rebuild this
## package. To protect the innocent, we define kversion and make the
## resulting package dependable on the specific version of the kernel.

## The only customizable variables are prefix and kversion.
## If you have used a custom tug in the vesrion of your kernel rpm,
## you may need to adjust mversion as well. 

## If i2c has been installed into a location defferent from prefix or /usr;
## you must define I2C_HEADERS below.
## This package IS relocatable (change prefix to relocate).

%define prefix /usr/local
%define I2C_HEADERS %{prefix}/include

#Define your kernel version here.
%define kversion %(uname -r)
%define mversion %{kversion}

%description
This package contains a collection of user space tools for general SMBus
access and hardware monitoring. SMBus, also known as System Management Bus,
is a protocol for communicating through a I2C ('I squared C') bus. Many modern
mainboards have a System Management Bus. There are a lot of devices which can
be connected to a SMBus; the most notable are modern memory chips with EEPROM
memories and chips for hardware monitoring.

Most modern mainboards incorporate some form of hardware monitoring chips.
These chips read things like chip temperatures, fan rotation speeds and
voltage levels. There are quite a few different chips which can be used
by mainboard builders for approximately the same results.

Hardware monitoring chips are often connected to the SMBus, but often they
can also be connected to the ISA bus. The modules in this package usually
support both ways of accessing them.
