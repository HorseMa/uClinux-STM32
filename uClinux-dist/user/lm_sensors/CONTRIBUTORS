This package could not have been created without the help of many, many people.
The most notable contributors are listed below. You are probably best off
to use the mailing list (see http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/author.html)
if you have questions, suggestions or problems.

* Alexander Larsson <alla@lysator.liu.se>
  Wrote the original lm78 module; lm_sensors version 1 was no more than an
  extension of this module. He still likes to keep an eye on current
  developments, but is usually too busy with other things to do much work
  on them
* Philip Edelbrock <phil@netroedge.com>
  Took up the development of the Alex' lm78 module. Responsible for most
  SMBus code, and many, many other things. He is still one of the main
  developers of the current package.
* Frodo Looijaard <frodol@dds.nl>
  Took up the development of Alex' lm78 module. Large pieces of code were
  written by him. Designed lm_sensors version 2, and wrote most of its
  core code, including many drivers.
* William Morgan <wmorgan@cmu.edu>
  Helped with some patches in lm_sensors version 1. He provided us with
  the original CVS archive, and even managed to explain to us how to use
  it.
* Kyösti Mälkki <kmalkki@cc.hut.fi>
  Author of the i2c-via and i2c-viapro host drivers. Sis5595 hack.
  Extended support for GL518SM and GL520SM sensors.

  Author of the i2c-ali15x3, i2c-i801, and i2c-i810 bus drivers.
  Author (with Bob Dougherty) of the via686a driver.
  Added w83782d, w83783s, w83627hf, and as99127f support to the w83781d driver.
  Added max1617, thmc10, gl523sm, and lm84 support to the adm1021 driver.
  Added lm81 support to the adm9240 driver.
