Title: lm_sensors
Version: 2.10.0
Entered-date: 29DEC98
Description: Hardware health monitoring package for Linux. It consists of 
             kernel modules to access sensor chips and SMBus hardware,
             of a library to allow applications to read this data more
             easily, and of an example program to pretty print this data.
             LM78, LM79, LM80, W83781D and GL518SM sensor chips are 
             supported, among others. PIIX4 and VIA chipset SMBus
             implementations are supported, as well as many I2C busses.
             Version 2 is a complete non-compatible modular rewrite of this 
             package, with full I2C and SMBus support.
