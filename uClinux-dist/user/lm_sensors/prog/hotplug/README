M7101 - SMBus Support for ALi M15x3 based motherboards.
For Asus P4B motherboards, use the p4b_smbus module;
see the file README.p4b.

NOTE:
This module is for 2.4 kernels only. For 2.6 kernels,
activation is handled by the code in drivers/pci/quirks.c
in the kernel source. If you have the latest 2.6 kernel and
the quirks code does not activate your SMBus, try adding support
in quirks.c, recompile and test your new kernel, and then
submit a patch to us. Contact us if you need assistance.

--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Start (2.4 kernels only):

	Verify that hotplug is enabled in your kernel (general setup)
		and reconfigure/rebuild/reinstall kernel if not
	"lspci" to verify that 7101 device is not present
	"make"
	(as root) "make install"
	(as root) "insmod m7101"
	"lspci" to verify that 7101 device is present

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2 for 2.4.0-testx kernels.
Mark D. Studebaker <mdsxyz123@yahoo.com>

*** You must have 'Support for hot-pluggable devices' enabled
*** in your kernel (under 'general setup') for this module to work!!

For 2.2 and early 2.3 kernels you must use version 0.1;
version 0.2 will not work.
Version 0.1 does not use the kernel hotplug facility.
Obtain version 0.1 here:

	README:            http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78/misc/README-m7101.txt
	source and README: http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78/misc/m7101-0.1.tar.gz



--------------------------------------------------------
Notes below for the 0.2 version, MDS.
--------------------------------------------------------
Default I/O addresses are 0xe800 for SMBus and 0xec00 for ACPI.

These can be changed at module insertion.
For example:
	insmod m7101 smb_io=0x5000 acpi_io=0x4000


--------------------------------------------------------
Notes below from the 0.1 version, B. Kohl.
--------------------------------------------------------

This module was written to enable SMBus support on ALi M15x3 chipset based
motherboards. Although it was written for and tested on Gigabytes GA-5AX 
it should work on any M15x3 chipset based board.

Probably most people trying this software on a GA-5AX will be utterly 
disappointed. We have seen no sensor chips on this board - only DIMMs
were connected to the SMBus. If you are trying to make lm_sensors read
temperature and voltage values you will be pretty lost.

CAVEAT: To perform it's task this module needs to manipulate PCI-config
data and device structures on a very low level. This bears the risk of 
causing havoc to your system in case anything goes wrong. Use this soft-
ware absolutely at your own risk.


Installation:
Untar the m7101.tgz file into an appropriate location and cd into the
m7101 subdirectory. Then type "make" to build the module file 'm7101.o'.
To insert it type 
	$ insmod m7101.o 
as root.

If everything goes well (no error messages) you will see a description like
the following when doing 'lspci -v':

00:03.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M7101 PMU
        Flags: medium devsel
        I/O ports at 4000
        I/O ports at 5000

and find an entry in the proc filesystem under /proc/bus/pci/00/03.0.


Removing the module removes the M7101 device from the proc file system
and switches the SMBus support off.

The lm_sensors software now should be able to access devices on the 
motherboard's SMBus through the M7101. 

Values for the ACPI-IO port (normally 0x4000) and the SMBus-IO port
(normally 0x5000) can be specified using the parameters acpi_io and 
smbus_io respectively on the insmod command line.
The module defaults to ports 0xec00 and 0xe800.

In case the module does not load you might want to switch on debugging
by uncommenting the second CFLAGS-line (with the -DM7101_DEBUG switch)
in the Makefile.

This module was written to activate SMBus support. I don't know neither
have I tested wether it works with the software from the ACPI project.

Note: Egcs compilers with versions below 2.95.2 do not compile properly.
Use either 2.95.2 or gcc 2.7.2.x.

I have tested this module with 2.2 kernels up to version 2.2.14.


I wish to thank Frank Bauer for his help with this module.
