.SH NAME
sensors \- printing sensors information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sensors [
.I options
.B ] [
.I chips
.B ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sensors
is used to show the current readings of all sensor chips, and to set all limits
as specified in the configuration file.

.B sensors
knows about certain chips, and outputs nicely formatted readings for them; but
it can also display the information of unknown chips, as long as 
.I libsensors
knows about them.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c config-file"
Specify a configuration file. If no file is specified, the name `sensors.conf'
is used. If the name does not contain a directory slash, or this parameter
is not present, the following path is examined:
.BR /etc ,
.BR /usr/lib/sensors ,
.BR /usr/local/lib/sensors ,
.BR /usr/lib ,
.BR /usr/local/lib ,
.B .
.IP -h
Prints a help text
.IP -s
Evaluates all `set' statements in the configuration file. You must probably
be `root' to do this. If this parameter is not specified, no `set' statement
is evaluated.
.IP -a
Show the algorithm for each chipset. Note that algorithms are no more named
since Linux 2.6, so this option is deprecated and will probably go away in
a near future.
.IP -A
Do not show the adapter for each chipset.
.IP -U
Hide unknown chips.
.IP -u
Treats all chips as unknown ones. Output will be of much lower quality;
this option is only added for testing purposes.
.IP -v
Returns the program version.
.IP -f
Prints the temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.
.SH FILES
.I /etc/sensors.conf
.RS
The system wide configuration file. See
.BR sensors.conf (5)
for further details.
