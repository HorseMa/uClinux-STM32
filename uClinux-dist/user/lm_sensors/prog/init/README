This directory contains files useful for initialization
scripts, especially for RedHat and SuSE.

There are two choices, lm_sensors.init and sensord.init.
Use one or the other but not both!

----------------

The script lm_sensors.init is a nice startup/shutdown script.
On RH and other RH-based systems (MDK, notably) use this sort of startup
mechanism (i.e. SVR4-based), as opposed to the everything-in-one-script
(/etc/rc or /etc/rc.local) like the BSD-based systems do.
The lm_sensors.init file should be copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/lm_sensors.
For more information see the top of the file.
It requires the /etc/sysconfig/sensors file, which identifies
the correct modules.

The /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors file is only a list of modules,
as would be determined by running sensors-detect.
The lm_sensors.sysconfig file contains the MODULE_# variable definitions;
it should be modified for your setup and then
copied to /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors.

SuSE users will want to use lm_sensors.init.suse instead, which is
more specifically designed for this distribution. Changes were contributed
by Marc Rieffel <marc@paracel.com>.

----------------

The script sensord.init also loads the modules, and then
starts the sensord daemon. See the directory ../sensord for
more information on the daemon.

The sensord.init file should be copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/sensord.
For more information see the top of the file.

To configure this service one should put appropriate "alias i2c-bus-0 xxx"
and "alias i2c-sensors-chip-0 xxx" in /etc/modules.conf.
