.B -V

.SH DESCRIPTION
i2cdump is a small helper program to examine registers
visible through the I2C bus.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -V
Display the version and exit.
.TP
.B -y
Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cdump will wait for a confirmation
from the user before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it
will perform the operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.
.PP
At least two options must be provided to i2cdump. \fIi2cbus\fR indicates the
number of the I2C bus to be scanned. This number should correspond to one
of the busses listed by \fIi2cdetect -l\fR. \fIaddress\fR indicates the
address to be scanned on that bus, and is an integer between 0x00 and 0x7F. The
\fImode\fR parameter, if specified, is one of the letters \fBb\fP, \fBw\fP,
\fBs\fP, or \fBi\fP, corresponding to a read size of a single byte, a 16-bit
word, an SMBus block, an I2C block, respectively. The \fBc\fP mode is a
little different, it reads all bytes consecutively, and is useful for chips that
have an address auto-increment feature. A \fBp\fP can also be appended to the
\fImode\fR parameter to enable PEC. If the \fImode\fR parameter is omitted,
i2cdump defaults to byte access without PEC.
.PP
The \fIbank\fR and \fIbankreg\fR parameters are useful on the W83781D and
similar chips (at the time of writing, all Winbond and Asus chips).
\fIbank\fR is an integer between 0 and 7, and \fIbankreg\fR is an integer
between 0x00 and 0xFF (default value: 0x4E). The W83781D data sheet has more
information on bank selection.

.SH WARNING
i2cdump can be dangerous if used improperly. Most notably, the \fBc\fP mode
starts with WRITING a byte to the chip. On most chips it will be stored in the
address pointer register, which is OK, but some chips with a single register
or no (visible) register at all will most likely see this as a real WRITE,
resulting in possible misbehavior or corruption. Do not use i2cdump
on random addresses. Anyway, it is of little use unless you have an idea of
what you are looking for and have some general knowledge about hardware
monitoring chips internals.
