Description
-----------

This driver implements support for ISA accesses *only* for
the Winbond W83627HF, W83627THF, W83697HF, W83637HF and W83687THF
Super I/O chips. We will refer to them collectively as Winbond chips.

This driver supports ISA accesses, which should be more reliable
than i2c accesses. Also, for Tyan boards which contain both a
Super I/O chip and a second i2c-only Winbond chip (often a W83782D),
using this driver will avoid i2c address conflicts and complex
initialization that were required in the w83781d driver
(lm_sensors releases 2.7.0 and earlier).

If you really want i2c accesses for these Super I/O chips,
use the w83781d driver. However this is not the preferred method
now that this ISA driver has been developed.

The w83627_HF_ uses pins 110-106 as VID0-VID4. The w83627_THF_ uses the
same pins as GPIO[0:4]. Technically, the w83627_THF_ does not support a
VID reading. However the two chips have the identical 128 pin package. So,
it is possible or even likely for a w83627thf to have the VID signals routed
to these pins despite their not being labeled for that purpose. Therefore,
the w83627thf driver interprets these as VID. If the VID on your board
doesn't work, first see doc/vid. If that still doesn't help, you may just
ignore the bogus VID reading with no harm done.

For further information on this driver, /proc values, etc.
see the w83781d driver documentation.
