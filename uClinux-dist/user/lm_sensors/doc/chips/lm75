Description
-----------

The LM75 implements one temperature sensor. Limits can be set through the
Overtemperature Shutdown register and Hysteresis register. Each value can be 
set and read to half-degree accuracy.
An alarm is issued (usually to a connected LM78) when the temperature
gets higher then the Overtemperature Shutdown value; it stays on until
the temperature falls below the Hysteresis value.
All temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and are guaranteed within a 
range of -55 to +125 degrees.

The LM75 only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.

The LM75 is usually used in combination with LM78-like chips, to measure
the temperature of the processor(s).

The DS75, DS1775, MAX6625, MAX6626, and others are supported as well.
They are not distinguished from an LM75. While most of these chips
have three additional bits of accuracy (12 vs. 9 for the LM75),
the additional bits are not supported. Not only that, but these chips will
not be detected if not in 9-bit precision mode (use the force parameter if
needed).
The prefix in the /proc directory is still 'lm75'.

The LM75 is essentially an industry standard; there may be other
LM75 clones not listed here, with or without various enhancements,
that are supported.

The LM77 is not supported, contrary to what we pretended for a long time.
Both chips are simply not compatible, value encoding differs.
