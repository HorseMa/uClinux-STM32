Kernel driver `mtp008.o'
=========================

Status: Complete; Beta.
        This chip is quite configurable and many settings cannot
        be done through the driver. Hopefully the BIOS settings will
	be correct for most motherboards.

Supported chips:
  * Myson MTP008
    Prefix: 'mtp008'
    Addresses scanned: I2C 0x2c - 0x2e
    Datasheet: Publicly available at the Myson website

Description
-----------

The Myson MTP008 is similar in function to the Winbond W83781D and the
National Semi LM78. See documentation for those chips for an overview.


The MTP008 chip has several pins that are configurable.

The three temperature sensors are configurable via the driver
using either the /proc entries or 'set sensorx y' statements in
/etc/sensors.conf.
One temperature input is always temp1, and the sensor type is configured
with the sensor1 entry in /proc.
One input is either in4 or temp2, and is configured with the sensor2 entry.
One input is either in5 or temp3, and is configured with the sensor3 entry.

For example, on the Tyan S1824D motherboard,
AIN4 is configured as PII temp sensor 2 and
AIN5 is hooked up to the -12V sensing circuit.

Other Tyan motherboards (the 2510 Thunder and the Tiger 200) appear to
have different configurations.

For the 2510, which has two MTP008 chips, each with a different
configuration, follow the instructions in the mtp008 section of
etc/sensors.conf.eg to configure 'sensors' correctly.

The PWM outputs are configurable via the driver.
PWM values are from 0 to 255. The first value in the /proc entry is
the pwm value; the second is the enable (0 or 1).

The fan3 and pwm1 functions share a pin.
If pwm1 is enabled than fan3 will read as 0.

The Fan input types (2 wire or 3 wire) are configurable but
not via the driver.

The driver now preserves pin settings that the BIOS configures.
If your BIOS did it right then the driver should work great.

The MTP008 has sensor type selection in /proc like the Winbond W83782D.
However, the appropriate values used to make the selection are different.

To select a sensor type, echo the value to the /proc entry, for example:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/dev/sensors/mtp008-i2c-0-2d/sensor1
Or, use /etc/sensors.conf and add a line 'set sensor1 1', for example.
Hopefully the BIOS has set these already.

Sensor selection is as follows:

      Value	Function					Valid on sensors
      -----	--------					----------------
	1	Analog input (not for temperature sensing)	2,3
	2	Thermistor					1,2,3
	3	Pentium diode					1,2
