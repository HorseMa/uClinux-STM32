Description
-----------

The LM63 is a digital temperature sensor with integrated fan monitoring
and control.

All temperature values are given in degrees Celsius. Resolution is 1.0
degree for the local temperature, 0.125 degree for the remote temperature.

The fan speed is measured using a tachometer. Contrary to most chips which
store the value in an 8-bit register and have a selectable clock divider
to make sure that the result will fit in the register, the LM63 uses 16-bit
value for measuring the speed of the fan. It can measure fan speeds down to
83 RPM, at least in theory.

Note that the pin used for fan monitoring is shared with an alert out
function. Depending on how the board designer wanted to use the chip, fan
speed monitoring will or will not be possible. The proper chip configuration
is left to the BIOS, and the driver will blindly trust it.

A PWM output can be used to control the speed of the fan. The LM63 has two
PWM modes: manual and automatic. Automatic mode is not fully implemented yet
(you cannot define your custom pwm/temperature curve), and mode change isn't
supported either.

The lm63 driver will not update its values more frequently than every
second; reading them more often will do no harm, but will return 'old'
values.
