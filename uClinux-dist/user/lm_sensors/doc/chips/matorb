Kernel driver `matorb.o'
=======================

Status: 'Beta', but it's so simple that it may be in its final state

Supported devices: 
  * Matrix-Orbital (www.matrix-orbital.com) displays.  Developed and
    	tested on the LCD2041V, but should work with all their displays.
    Prefix: 'matorb'
    Addresses scanned: I2C 0x2E
    Datasheet: Publicly available at the Matrix-Orbital web site
    (www.matrix-orbital.com)

  List of adapter,address pairs to boldly assume to be present
* force_matorb: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs which are unquestionably assumed to contain
  a `bt869' chip
* ignore: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs not to scan
* ignore_range: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples not to scan
* probe: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,address pairs to scan additionally
* probe_range: short array (min = 1, max = 48)
  List of adapter,start-addr,end-addr triples to scan additionally


Description
-----------
This driver provides access to the Matrix-Orbital display devices.  These
devices are usually in the form of a small LCD (20x4 is typical) screen
which is mounted in a carrier which is then mounted into a 5.25" drive bay
of a computer.

This driver allows the user to send any data to the display to control or
display anything which the display supports.

Use
---
To use, just redirect the base-10 ordinal value of bytes (or chars) to the
display.  For example, to clear the screen and write a simple message, you
could do this:

# To clear the screen, send byte 0xFE and the char 'X' (ordinal 88)
echo "254 88" > /proc/sys/dev/sensors/matorb*/disp

# To display "hi there"
echo "hi there" \
  | perl -e '$_=<STDIN>; while (/(.)/gc) { print ord($1)," "; }' \
  > /proc/sys/dev/sensors/matorb*/disp

I've written a simple sample program (in Perl) to display a full screen
of text (which is fed in on standard-input) to the display.  It is in the
prog/matorb folder of this project.

I think the displays are very attractive and add a neat sort of 'status'
display to things like servers.  It would be very simple to either 
make a script daemon (or modify the healthd provided in this project)
to display a current status of health info (voltages, fans, temps, etc.)
on the display.  Let's see Windoze do *THAT*! :')
 

Issues
------
Redirecting too long of a string (32 ordinals seem to be the max) to 'disp'
seems to cause problems.  Keep things in small chunks (like lines).

Built in functions (screen clearing, etc.) were initially planned to be
added as other device files (other than just 'disp'), but these functions
are just as easily done by sending the command sequences to disp (as shown
above when clearing the screen).  This also ensures that the driver will
be compatible with all the displays.

Detection is very poor (as of this writing, anyway).  It looks for a device
at 0x2E and asumes it is a display.  Unfortunately, the 'beta' firmware
the Matrix-Orbital people gave me doesn't have good detection abilities to
it (it ignores reads... it used to lock up the bus on reads, so at least
it doesn't do that any more! :').  If they provide an easy way to 'sense'
that it is a display (and what kind it is?) then I will add support for it.

Let me know if you have problems which you can't figure out 
(phil@netroedge.com).
