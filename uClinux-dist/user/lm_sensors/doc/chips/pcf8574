Description
-----------
The PCF8574(A) is an 8-bit I/O expander for the I2C bus produced by Philips 
Semiconductors. It is designed to provide a byte I2C interface to up to 16 
separate devices (8 x PCF8574 and 8 x PCF8574A).

This device consists of a quasi-bidirectionnal port. Each of the eight I/Os
can be independently used as an input or output. To setup an I/O as an
input, you have to write a 1 to the corresponding output.

For more informations see the datasheet.


Accessing PCF8574(A) via /proc interface
-------------------------------------

! Be careful !
The PCF8574(A) is plainly impossible to detect ! Stupid chip.
So every chip with adress in the interval [20..27] and [38..3f] is
detected as PCF8574(A). If you have other chips in this address
range, the workaround is to load this module after the one
for your others chips.

On detection (i.e. insmod, modprobe et al.), directories are being
created for each detected PCF8574(A):

/proc/sys/dev/sensors/pcf8574-<0>-<1>/
where <0> is the bus the chip was detected on (e. g. i2c-0)
and <1> the chip address ([20..27] or [38..3f]): 
./pcf8574-i2c-0-27/

Inside these directories, there are two files each:
read and write.

The read file is read-only. Reading gives you the current I/O input
if the corresponding output is set as 1, otherwise the current output
value, that is to say 0.

The write file is read/write. Writing a value outputs it on the I/O
port. Reading return the last written value.

On module initialization the chip is configured as eight inputs (all
outputs to 1), so you can connect any circuit to the PCF8574(A) without
being afraid of short-circuit.
