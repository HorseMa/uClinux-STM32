<h3 class="section">1.1 What sensors are available on my PC?</h3>

<p>Most PC's built since late 1997 now come with a
hardware health monitoring chip. This chip may be accessed via the
ISA bus or the SMBus, depending on the motherboard.

   <p>Some motherboard chipsets, notably the Via 686 and the SiS 5595,
contain hardware monitor functions.

   <p>This FAQ frequently refers to the "LM78". This chip has been
obsoleted by National Semiconductor. Most motherboards today contain
a chip with similar functions.

<h3 class="section">1.2 What can a sensor chip like the "LM78" do?</h3>

<p>The LM78 is a chip made by National Semiconductor which can monitor 7
voltages (5 positive, 2 negative) from 0 to 4.08V.  The inputs are usually in
series with voltage dividers which lower the +/- 12V and +/- 5V supplies to
measurable range.  Therefore, the readings for such inputs need to be
re-scaled appropriately by software.

   <p>The LM78 also has 3 fan speed monitoring inputs, an internal
temperature sensor, a chassis intrusion sensor, and a couple maskable interrupt
inputs.  The LM78 can also relay the processor's (P6 or Pent II) VID lines
which are hardwired and used to indicate to the power regulator (usually on
the mainboard close to the processor socket/slot) what voltage to supply to
the processor.

   <p>The LM78 can be interfaced to a system via the ISA bus and/or the
SMBus.

   <p>Most other sensor chips have comparable functionality. Each supported
chip is documented in the <span class="file">doc/chips</span> directory.

<h3 class="section">2.1 How are these sensors read?</h3>

<p>Sensor chips reside on either the ISA bus, the SMBus, or both. 
See the file <span class="file">doc/chips/SUMMARY</span> in our package for a list.

   <p>To communicate with chips on the ISA bus, the software uses
simple I/O reads and writes.

   <p>To communicate with chips on the SMBus, the software must
use an SMBus interface device, explained below.

<h3 class="section">2.2 What is the SMBus? And the I2C bus?</h3>

<p>The SMBus is the "System Management Bus".  More specifically, it is a
2-wire, low-speed serial communication bus used for basic health monitoring
and hardware management. It is a specific implementation of the more
general I2C (pronunciation: I-squared-C) bus. In fact, both I2C devices
and SMBus devices may be connected to the same (I2C) bus.

   <p>The SMBus (or I2C bus) starts at the host controller, used for
starting transactions on the SMBus.  From the host interface, the
devices communicated with are the <dfn>slave</dfn> devices.  Each slave device has a
unique 7-bit address which the host uses to refer to that device.

   <p>For each supported SMBus host, there is a separate kernel module
which implements the communication protocol with the host. Some SMBus hosts
really operate on the SMBus level; these hosts can not cope with pure I2C
devices. Other hosts are in fact I2C hosts: in this case, we implement
the SMBus protocol in terms of I2C operations. But these hosts can also
talk to pure I2C devices.

<h3 class="section">2.3 I don't have an ISA bus!</h3>

<p>We promise, you do, even if you don't have any old ISA slots. 
The "ISA Bus" exists in your computer even if you don't have ISA slots;
it is simply a memory-mapped area, 64KB in size (0x0000 - 0xFFFF)
where many "legacy" functions, such as keyboard and interrupt controllers,

<h3 class="section">2.4 What sensors do processors have?</h3>

<p>Most new processors contain a thermal diode on the die itself. 
The electical properties of all diodes and transistors vary
slightly with temperature. The thermal diode is exceptionally accurate
because it is directly on the die. Newer temperature sensor chips,
like the Analog Devices ADM1021 and clones, and the Winbond chips,
have circuitry for measuring the the electrical properties of
an external diode and converting this data to a temperature. 
Any sensor chip listed in <span class="file">doc/chips/SUMMARY</span> in our package which
has support for more than one temperature supports external temperature sensing.

   <p>Older motherboards and processors without this feature generally use
an LM75 placed close to the processor. This is much less accurate.

   <p>The Pentium 2 'boxed' processor usually has an LM75 very close to the
base of the box. It can be read through the SMBus to report the approximate
temperature of the processor.  The processor also contains an internal
temperature sensor (of low accuracy) used as a fail-safe to disable the
processor in case it gets much too hot (usually around 130 degrees C).  And,
the Pentium 2 also has a hard-wired signal (VID lines) on it's SEC (single
edge connector) which indicates what power supply is required to operate the
processor.

   <p>The P6 (Pentium-Pro) may have an LM75 in or just under the socket. 
P6's also have VID lines.

   <p>Pentiums and Pentium w/ MMX do not have VID lines, and sometimes have
LM75's under the sockets (depends on the mainboard, and how 'modern' the
mainboard is).

   <p>The P2 Xeon was the first Intel processor to include the SMBus
interface on the P2 Xeon SEC.

<h3 class="section">2.5 How often are the sensor values updated?</h3>

<p>The LM78, and most other sensor chips like it, reads its sensors one
by one. A complete scanning sweep will take about 1.5 seconds. The LM78 stops
readings sensors if you try to access it, so if you access it very often
(by reading sensor values; writing new limits is safe) it will not find the
time to update its sensor values at all! Fortunately, the kernel module takes
care not to do this, and only reads new values each 1.5 seconds. If you
read the values again, you will get the 'old' values again.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.6 How are alarms triggered?</h3>

<p>It is possible to monitor each sensor and have an alarm go off if
it crosses some pre-determined limits.  There are two sorts of interrupts
which can be generated by sensor chips if this happens (it depends a bit on
the actual chip if both are supported; the LM80, for example, has only
IRQ interrupts): IRQ interrupts and SMI interrupts.  IRQ stands for
Interrupt Request and are the interrupt lines you can find in <span class="file">/proc/interrupts</span>. 
SMI stands for System Management Interrupt, and is a special interrupt which
puts the processor in a secure environment independent of any other things
running.  SMI is currently not supported by the Linux kernel.  IRQs are
supported, of course.

   <p>Even if no interrupt is generated, some bits in a status register
will be set until the register is read the next time. If the alarm condition
persists after that, the bits will be set on the next scanning sweep, etc.

   <p>Most drivers in our package do not support interrupts at this time.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Why so many modules, and how do I cope with them?</h3>

<p>We tried to make this package as modular as possible. This makes it
easy to add new drivers, and unused drivers will take no precious kernel
space. On the other hand, it can be a bit confusing at first.

   <p>Here are two simple guidelines:
     <ul>
  <li>Run <span class="command">sensors-detect</span> and do what it tells you. 
  <li>Always use <span class="command">modprobe</span>, not <span class="command">insmod</span>. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">3.2 How do I know which chips I own?</h3>

<p>We have an excellent program that scans all your hardware. 
It is called <span class="file">sensors-detect</span> and is installed in <span class="file">/usr/local/sbin</span>
by <span class="command">make install</span>. Just execute this script, and it will tell you.

   <p>Chip detection in the drivers is fairly good. That means that it is
usually harmless to insert more chip drivers than you need. However, this
can still lead to problems, so we do not recommend it.

   <p>If sensors-detect didn't find any sensors, either you don't have
any, or the ones you have, we don't support. (Look at your motherboard
for candidates, then see <a href="#Help">Help</a>)

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 What chips are on motherboard XYZ?</h4>

<p><strong>!!!!!!!!! YES THIS IS THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTION WE GET !!!!!!!!!</strong>

   <p>We have no idea. Here is what you should do:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
  <li>Run sensors-detect.
        </ol>

   <p>If that doesn't work:
     <ol type=1 start=2>
<li>Look at your motherboard. 
<li>Check the manufacturer's website or ask their support
<li>Check the <a href="http://mbm.livewiredev.com/">Motherboard Monitor</a> website and the

recommends and paste them into the appropriate <span class="file">/etc/rc.d/xxxx</span> file
to be executed at startup.

   <p>You need one module for each sensor chip and bus adapter you own;
if there are sensor chips on the ISA bus, you also need <span class="file">i2c-isa.o</span>. 
for each type of chip you own. That's all. On my computer, I could use the
following lines:
     <ul>
<li><span class="command">modprobe i2c-isa</span>

<h3 class="section">3.4 Do I need the configuration file <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>?</h3>

<p>Yes, for any applications that use <span class="file">libsensors,</span> including the
<span class="command">sensors</span> application included in our package. 
It tells libsensors how to translate the values the chip
measures to real-world values. This is especially important for voltage
inputs. The default configuration file should usually do the trick. 
It is automatically installed as <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>, but it will not
overwrite any existing file with that name.

   <p><a name="Section-3_002e4_002e1"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.1 The labels for the voltage and temperature readings in <span class="command">sensors</span> are incorrect!</h4>

<p>Every motherboard is different. You can customize the labels
in the file <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>. That's why it exists! 
The default labelling (in <span class="file">lib/chips.c</span> and <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>) is just
a template.

   <p><a name="Section-3_002e4_002e2"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.2 The min and max for the readings in <span class="command">sensors</span> are incorrect!</h4>

<p>Don't worry about them. The dependency files (which tell which

dynamically. They are not distributed with the package. The <span class="command">make</span> program
notices they are not there, and warns about that - and the first thing
it will do is generate them. So all is well.

   <p>You can also run <span class="command">depmod -a -e</span> to see all unresolved symbols.

   <p>These are module versioning problems. Generally you did not compile

You must compile our package against the source for the kernel you

   <p>Try the following to be sure:

     <ul>
<li><span class="command">nm --extern MODULE.o</span>
Filter out the kernel symbols, like <code>kmalloc</code>, <code>printk</code> etc. and note the
number code behind them, like <code>printk_R1b7d4074</code>. If there is no numeric
code after them, note this too. 
<li><span class="command">grep SYMBOL /proc/ksyms</span>
Substitute SYMBOL by the basename of the symbols above, like <code>kmalloc</code>,
<code>printk</code> etc. Note the number code behind them, or the lack thereof.

<h3 class="section">3.10 I2C_DRIVERID_ADM1024 undefined (Red Hat especially)</h3>

<p>In some versions of Redhat, an RPM is included to provide i2c support. 
However, this RPM does not place the header files in the kernel directory
structure.  When you update kernels, they may persist.  To get rid of
these obsolete header files, at a command prompt:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><span class="command">rpm -qa | grep i2c</span>
<li>Look for <span class="file">kernel-i2c,</span> or a similar rpm in the output
<li>&lt;as root&gt;
<span class="command">rpm -ev kernel-i2c</span> (or the name of the similar package)
If this complains about dependencies, you can try adding
<span class="command">--nodeps</span>, but this *MAY* break something else.  Not likely,
as you have upgraded kernels, and nothing should be using the
old i2c stuff anymore anyway.  Just don't use it with abandon. 
<li>Try (in the build directory of <span class="file">lm_sensors)</span>
     <pre class="example">          <span class="command">make clean</span>
          <span class="command">make</span>
     </pre>
     <li><em>If</em> you still have problems, you may have to replace the include
paths in the <span class="file">.c/.h</span> files with absolute paths to the header files. 
More of a workaround than a real fix, but at least you can get it
to work.

<h3 class="section">4.1 My fans report exactly half/double their values compared to the BIOS?</h3>

<p>The problem with much of the sensor data is that it is impossible to
properly interpret some of the readings without knowing what the hardware
configuration is.  Some fans report one 'tick' each rotation, some report
two 'ticks' each rotation. It is easy to resolve this through the
configuration file <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>:

<pre class="example">     chip lm78-*             # Or whatever chip this relates to
     compute fan1 2*@,@/2    # This will double the fan1 reading
                             # -- or --

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 I doubled the fan divisor and the fan still reads 7000!</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, doubling the 'fan divisor' will not halve
the fan reading. You have to add a compute line in <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>.

<p>For starters, those aren't LM75's.  Your mainboard actually has the
Winbond W83781D which emulates two LM75's, but many systems which use the
Winbond chip (such as the Asus P2B) don't have the thermo-resisters connected
to the chip resulting in these strange -48 degree readings.

   <p>In upcoming versions, you will be able to disable non-interesting

<h3 class="section">4.3 Why do I have two Vcore readings, I have only one processor!</h3>

<p>The LM78 has seven voltage sensors. The default way of
connecting them is used in the configuration file. This includes a VCore2,
even if you do not have one. You can easily edit the configuration file
to give it another name, or make this reading disappear using
an <span class="command">ignore</span> line.

   <p>Note that Vcore2 is often the same as Vcore on motherboards which
only support one processor. Another possibility is that Vcore2 is not
connected at all and will not have a valid reading at all. 
A third possibility, is that Vcore2 monitors something
else, so you should not be too surprised if the values are completely
different.

<h3 class="section">4.4 How do those ALARMS work? The current value is within range but there is still an ALARM warning!</h3>

<p>The ALARM indications in <span class="command">sensors</span> are those reported by the
sensor chip itself. They are NOT calculated by <span class="command">sensors</span>. <span class="command">sensors</span>
simply reads the ALARM bits and reports them.

   <p>An ALARM will go off when a minimum or maximum limit is crossed. 
The ALARM is then latched - that is, it will stay there until the
chip's registers are next accessed - which will be the next time
you read these values, but not within (usually) 1.5 seconds since the last
update.

   <p>Reading the registers clears the ALARMS, unless the current
value is still out of range.

   <p>The purpose of this scheme is to tell you if there has been
a problem and report it to the user. Voltage or temperature spikes
get detected without having to read the sensor chip hundreds of times
a second. The implemetation details depend a bit on the kind of chip. 
See the specific chip documentation in <span class="file">doc/chips</span> and the
chip datasheet for more information.

<h3 class="section">4.5 My voltage readings seem to drift a bit. Is something wrong?</h3>

<p>No, probably not. If your motherboard heats up a bit, the sensed
voltages will drift a bit. If your power supply is loaded (because a disk
gets going, for example), the voltages may get a bit lower. Heavy
processor activity, in particular, dramatically increases core voltage
supply load which will often cause variation in the other supplies. 
As long as they stay within a sensible range (say 5% of the nominal value
for CPU core voltages, and 10% for other voltages), there is no
reason to worry.

<h3 class="section">4.6 Some measurements are way out of range. What happened?</h3>

<p>Each module tries to set limits to sensible values on initialization,
but a module does not know how a chip is actually connected. This is
described in the configuration file, which is not read by kernel modules. 
So limits can be strange, if the chip is connected in a non-standard way.

   <p>Readings can also be strange; there are several reasons for this. 
Temperature sensors, for example, can simply not be present, even though
the chip supports them. Also, it can be that the input is used in a
non-standard way. You can use the configuration file to describe how this
measurement should be interpreted; see the comments the example file for
more information.

<h4 class="subsection">4.6.1 -5V and -12V readings are way out of range!</h4>

<p>It's very frequent that negative voltage lines are not wired because
motherboard manufacturers don't think they're worth monitoring
(they are mostly unused these days). You can just add
<span class="command">ignore inN</span> lines to <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span> to hide them.

   <p>Another possibility is that these lines are used to monitor different
voltages. Only the motherboard manufacturer can tell for sure. Taking
a look at what voltage values the BIOS displays may provide valuable
hints though.

<h3 class="section">4.7 What are VID lines? Why is the VID reading wrong?</h3>

<p>These describe the core voltage for your processor. They are
supported for most processors, however they are not always
correctly connected to the sensor chip, so the readings may be invalid. 
A reading of 0V, +3.5V or +2.05V is especially suspect. 
If this is the case, add a line <span class="command">ignore vid</span> to <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>,
and change the min and max settings for the Processor Core voltage
(often in0_min and in0_max) in that file so that they don't depend on vid.

   <p>The CPU nominal voltage is computed from VID lines according to a formula
that depends on the CPU type. Most chips that report a VID value can be
configured to use either VRM 8.2 (for Pentium III) or VRM 9.0 (for Pentium 4
and Athlon). You chose which one you want through <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span>.

<h3 class="section">4.8 I read sensor values several times a second, but they are only updated only each second or so. Why?</h3>

<p>If we would read the registers more often, it would not find the
time to update them. So we only update our readings once each 1.5 seconds
(the actual delay is chip-specific; for some chips, it may not be needed
at all).

<h3 class="section">4.9 It sometimes seems to take almost a second before I see the sensor reading results. Why?</h3>

<p>ISA bus access is fast, but SMBus access is really slow. If you have
a lot of sensors, it just takes a lot of time to access them. Fortunately,
this has almost no impact on the system as a whole, as another job can run
while we are waiting for the transaction to finish.

<h3 class="section">4.10 Can I be alerted when an ALARM occurs?</h3>

<p>No, you can't; and it may well be never supported.

   <p>Almost no mainboard we have encountered have actually connected the
IRQ-out pin of sensor chips. That means that we could enable IRQ reporting, but
nothing would happen. Also, even if a motherboard has it connected, it is
unclear what interrupt number would be triggered. And IRQ lines are a scarce
facility, which means that almost nobody would be able to use it anyway.

   <p>The SMI interrupt is only available on a few types of chips. It is
really a very obscure way to handle interrupts, and supporting it under Linux
might be quite hard to do.

   <p>Your best bet would be to poll the alarm file with a user-land daemon
which alerts you if an alarm is raised. I am not aware of any program which
does the job, though you might want to examine one of the graphical monitor
programs under X, see <a href="http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/useful_addresses.html">http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/useful_addresses.html</a> for addresses.

<h3 class="section">4.11 SMBus transactions on my PIIX4 simply don't work (timeouts happen).  Why?</h3>

<p>Some chips which mainboard makers connect to the SMBus are not SMBus
devices.  An example is the 91xx clock generator chips.  When read, these
devices can lock up the SMBus until the next hard reboot.  This is because
they have a similar serial interface (like the I2C), but don't conform to
Intel's SMBus standard.

   <p>Why did they connect these devices to the SMBus if they aren't
compatible?  Good question! :')  Actually, these devices may support being
written to, but lock things up when they are read.

<h3 class="section">4.12 My BIOS reports a much higher CPU temperature than your modules!</h3>

<p>We display the actual temperature of the sensor. This may not be the
temperature you are interested in, though.  If a sensor should measure
the CPU temperature, it must be in thermal contact with it.  In practice,
it may be just somewhere nearby. Your BIOS may correct for this (by adding,
for example, thirty degrees to the measured temperature).  The correction
factor is regrettably different for each mainboard, so we can not do this
in the module itself. You can do it through the configuration file, though:

<pre class="example">     chip lm75-*-49                      # Or whatever chip this relates to
     label temp "Processor"
     compute temp @*1.2+13,(@-13)/1.2    # Or whatever formula
</pre>
   <p>However, the offset you are introducing might not be necessary. If you
tried to have Linux idle temperature and BIOS "idle" temperature match,
you may be misguided. 
We have a Supermicro (370DLE) motherboard and we know
that its BIOS has a closed, almost undelayed while(1) loop that
keeps the CPU busy all the time. Linux reads 26 degrees idle, BIOS reads
38 degrees. Linux at full load is in the 35-40 degrees range so this
makes sense.

<p>Yes, this is still a problem. It is partially solved by alias detection
and confidence values in sensors-detect, but it is really tough.

   <p>Double detections can be caused by two things:
sensors can be detected to both the ISA and the SMBus (and if you have
loaded the approprate adapter drivers, it will be detected on both), and
some chips simulate other chips (the Winbond W83781D simulates LM75 chips
on the SMBus, for example). Remove the offending adapter or chip driver, or
run sensors-detect and add the <span class="command">ignore=</span> modprobe parameters it suggests.

<p>Your SMBus (PIIX4?) is probably crashed or hung. There are some mainboards

hangs the PIIX4 if it is read (it is an I2C device, but not SMBus compatible). 
We have found no way of solving this, except for rebooting your computer. 
Next time when you run sensors-detect, you may want to exclude addresses
0x69 and/or 0x6a, by entering <kbd>s</kbd> when you are asked whether you want to
scan the PIIX4.

<h3 class="section">4.18 How do I configure two chips (LM87) differently?</h3>

<p>There is a SuperMicro board with two LM87's on it that are
not hooked up in the same way, so they need different defaults. 
For example, both CPU temperatures go to one LM87.

   <p>Make two different sections in <span class="file">/etc/sensors.conf</span> as follows:
<pre class="example">     chip "lm87-i2c-*-2c"
         put configuration for the chip at 0x2c here
     chip "lm87-i2c-*-2d"
         put configuration for the chip at 0x2d here
</pre>
   <p>There is a commented example in <span class="file">sensors.conf.eg</span> which should
be helpful.

<p>If the problem is a PCI device is not present in <span class="command">lspci</span>, the solution
is complex. For the ALI M7101 device, there is a solution which uses the
2.4 kernel's <span class="command">hotplug</span> facility. See <span class="file">prog/hotplug</span> in our package. 
For other PCI devices, you can try to modify
the m7101 solution in <span class="file">prog/hotplug</span>.

   <p>If dmesg says <span class="samp">try force_addr</span>, see below. Other drivers generally do not
support the force_addr parameter. Sorry. Check the documentation
for your driver in <span class="file">doc/[chips,busses]</span> and if we don't support it
you can send us your request.

<p>If the problem is a PCI device whose base address is not set,
you may be able to set the address with a force parameter. The via686a
and sis5595 chip drivers, and some bus drivers, support the command line
<span class="command">modprobe via686a force_addr=0xADDRESS</span> where ADDRESS
is the I/O address. You must select an address that is not in use. 
<span class="command">cat /proc/ioports</span> to check (carefully) for conflicts. A high number like
0xf000 is generally safe.

<h3 class="section">4.29 Inserting modules hangs my board</h3>

<p>There are several possible causes:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Bus driver problems. Insert the bus driver first, before you have inserted any chip drivers, to verify. 
<li>Wrong chip driver. Verify that you have a chip supported by the chip driver, see <a href="#Section-3_002e2_002e1">What chips are on motherboard XYZ</a>. 
<li>The chip driver is reinitializing the chip, which undoes critical initialization done by the BIOS.  Try the parameter <span class="command">init=0</span> for the w83781d driver; this is the only driver supporting this parameter. 
<li>Some chips on the bus don't like to be probed at all.  After inserting the bus driver (but not the chip drivers), run <span class="command">i2cdetect</span> on the bus, then <span class="command">i2cdump</span> on each address responding to <span class="command">i2cdetect</span>. This may find the culprit.  Do not <span class="command">i2cdump address 0x69</span>, the clock chip. 
<li>The chip driver is incorrectly finding a second chip on the bus and is accessing it. For example, with the Tyan 2688 with a w83781d at 0x29, use <span class="command">modprobe ignore_range=0,0x00,0x28,0,0x2a,0x7f</span> to prevent access to other addresses.

<h3 class="section">4.33 Problems on 2.6 kernels</h3>

<p>Not all drivers have been ported to 2.6. If your favorite driver is not
in 2.6, the reason is that nobody has ported it, or the ported code did
not get a proper review yet. 
If you would like to port the driver, see the file
Documentation/i2c/porting-clients in the 2.6 kernel tree for help,
then send us the ported driver when you are done.

<h4 class="subsection">4.33.1 i2c-viapro and via686a</h4>

<p>Until kernel 2.6.11, there was a PCI resource conflict between
i2c-viapro (the SMBus driver for VIA bridges) and via686a (the integrated
sensors driver for VIA bridges). This caused the second loaded driver to
silently fail working. So do not load both i2c-viapro and via686a together
unless you have a recent kernel.

<h4 class="subsection">4.33.2 Where are my EEPROMs?</h4>

<p>The 2.6.14-rc1 kernel introduced the hwmon class, which groups all
hardware monitoring drivers in a logical way. The goal was to help
libsensors grab the relevant sensors information in /sys. In particular:
     <ul>
<li>libsensors will no more need to know about the underlying bus types
(I2C/SMBus, ISA or other);
<li>libsensors will no more list non-hardware monitoring chips. 
</ul>
   This explains why EEPROMs are no more displayed by <span class="command">sensors</span>:
they are no hardware monitoring chips. The medium term plan is to drop
eeprom support for all Linux 2.6 kernels, as it didn't fit well in
the library code in the first place.

   <p>Note that you can still obtain information about your EEPROMs by using
the dedicated perl scripts in <span class="file">prog/eeprom</span>: <span class="command">ddcmon</span>,
<span class="command">decode-dimms.pl</span>, <span class="command">decode-edid.pl</span> and
<span class="command">decode-vaio.pl</span>.

<h3 class="section">5.1 What to send us when asking for help</h3>

<p>We are always willing to answer questions if things don't work out. 
Post your question to our <a href="http://lists.lm-sensors.org/mailman/listinfo/lm-sensors">discussion list</a>,
and not the individual authors,
unless you have something private to say.

   <p>Instead of using email, you can also use the web-based support
area, at <a href="http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/support.html">http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/support.html</a>. You will be helped
just as fast, and others may profit from the answer too. You will be
emailed automatically when your question has been answered.

   <p>Here's what you should send us:

     <ul>
<li>The dmesg or syslog output if applicable
<li>The output of (as root) <span class="command">prog/detect/sensors-detect</span>
<li>The output of <span class="command">lsmod</span>
<li>If a PCI chip problem:
          <ul>
<li>The output of <span class="command">lspci -n</span>
</ul>
     <li>If an I2C sensor chip problem:
          <ul>
<li>The output of (as root) <span class="command">prog/detect/i2cdetect X</span>
where X = the bus number (run <span class="command">i2cdetect</span> with no arguments to list the busses)
(please send this only if it's not all <span class="samp">XX</span>)
<li>The output of (as root) <span class="command">prog/dump/i2cdump X 0xXX</span>
where XX = the address of each chip you see in the output of <span class="command">i2cdetect</span>. (run once for each chip)
(please send this only if it's not all <span class="samp">ff</span>)
</ul>
     <li>If an ISA sensor chip problem:
          <ul>
<li>The output of (as root) <span class="command">prog/dump/isadump 0x295 0x296</span> (only if it's not all <span class="samp">XX</span>)
</ul>
     <li>Part numbers of chips on your motherboard you think are the sensor chips (look at your motherboard)
<li>Motherboard type
<li>Sensors version

<h3 class="section">5.2 What to do if a module won't insert?</h3>

<p>Did you use <span class="command">modprobe</span> instead of <span class="command">insmod</span>??? Don't use insmod.

   <p>Were there unresolved symbols? Did you run <span class="command">depmod -a</span>? Run
<span class="command">depmod -a -e</span> to see where the symbol problem is.

   <p>ALWAYS inspect the output of <span class="command">dmesg</span>. That's where the error
messages come out!!! Don't rely on the generic message from <span class="command">modprobe</span>. 
If you still can't figure it out, send us the information
listed above.

<h3 class="section">5.3 What to do if it inserts, but nothing happens?</h3>

<p>For an ISA sensor chip, did you also <span class="command">modprobe i2c-isa</span>? It must be inserted.

   <p>For an I2C sensor chip, did you also <span class="command">modprobe i2c-xxx</span> where xxx is your
I2C bus adapter? It must be inserted.

   <p>Always inspect the output of <span class="command">dmesg</span>. That's where the error

<h3 class="section">5.9 Why did you decide not to support undocumented chips?</h3>

<p>There are several reasons why we are generally not interested in writing
drivers for undocumented chips:

     <ul>
<li>Writing a driver without a datasheet is much harder, as you have to
guess most things. Remember that, most of the time, we write drivers for fun
and for free, so there is no reason we would write a driver in conditions
that promise more pain than fun. 
<li>If we hit a problem, we are certain never to get any support from the
chip manufacturer. This means that we may spend days on code which will
finally never work. 
<li>There are several chips out there which are fully documented and lack
a driver. This is natural for us to give these the priority when we
finally have some spare time to spend on driver coding. 
<li>Hardware monitoring chips are not toys. Misprogramming them can
result in data loss or hardware breakage. This is obviously more likely
to happen with undocumented chips. This is a responsability we do not
want to endorse (the GPL is pretty clear than we are not legally
liable, but still). 
</ul>

   <p>There are also several reasons why we do not want to support such drivers,
even if they were written by other people:

     <ul>
<li>Problems are much more likely to happen with such drivers. 
This means increased needs of support. User support if very
time-consuming and we are usually short of time. 
<li>Support should be done by the driver author (as only him/her knows
the driver and chip) but in the reality of facts, people will always ask
us for help if the driver is part of our package. Redirecting all user
requests to the driver's author manually is boring. 
<li>The lack of datasheet usually results in an original driver which
works relatively fine for its author, but will happen not to work
completely for other users. This means that the driver will need many
more additions and fixes than other drivers do, resulting in an increased
maitainance workload, which we can hardly afford. Of course this too should
be handled by the original driver author, but we never know whether he/she
will actually do the work. 
</ul>

   <p>Lastly, there are other considerations, some of which are deliberately
political:

     <ul>
<li>We do not want to trick hardware buyers into thinking that a chip is
fully supported under Linux when in fact it is only partly supported by a
driver which was written without a datasheet. Clearly stating that such
chips are not supported makes it much easier for anyone who really needs
fully working hardware monitoring under Linux to avoid motherboards with
these partly supported chips. 
<li>Drivers written without a datasheet are a pain for developers and
users, but are a complete win for the manufacturers of these chips:
they don't have to write the driver, they don't have to help us,
they don't have to support the users, and they still sell their
hardware. We do not want to encourage such a selfish behavior. 
</ul>

   <p>That being said, authors of such drivers can still submit their code to
the Linux kernel folks for inclusion into Linux 2.6. Their driver may be
accepted there, under conditions.

   <p>If such a driver is ever accepted into the Linux 2.6 tree, and someone
provides a patch to libsensors and/or sensors to add support for this
driver, we will apply it. This generic code is unlikely to cause trouble.
