Description
-----------

The ICH (properly known as the 82801AA), ICH0 (82801AB),
ICH2 (82801BA), ICH3 (82801CA/CAM) and later devices
are Intel chips that are a part of
Intel's '810' chipset for Celeron-based PCs,
'810E' chipset for Pentium-based PCs, '815E' chipset, and others.

The ICH chips contain at least SEVEN separate PCI functions
in TWO logical PCI devices.
An output of lspci will show something similar to the following:

  00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2418 (rev 01)
  00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2410 (rev 01)
  00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2411 (rev 01)
  00:1f.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2412 (rev 01)
  00:1f.3 Unknown class [0c05]: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2413 (rev 01)

The SMBus controller is function 3 in device 1f.
Class 0c05 is SMBus Serial Controller.

If you do NOT see the 24x3 device at function 3, and you can't
figure out any way in the BIOS to enable it,
(and especially if you have an Asus P4B board),
see prog/hotplug/README.p4b.

The ICH chips are quite similar to Intel's PIIX4 chip,
at least in the SMBus controller.

See the file i2c-piix4 for some additional information.


Process Call Support
--------------------

Not supported.


I2C Block Read Support
----------------------

The ICH4 supports a special 3-byte address (command code
plus 2 more bytes) I2C block read.
The driver and the kernel i2c protocol stack do not
support this.
The ICH5 and higher support a standard 1-byte address (command code)
I2C block read. The driver does support this.


SMBus 2.0 Support
-----------------

The 82801DB (ICH4) and later chips support several SMBus 2.0 features.
Kernel and driver support are as follows:

Feature		Kernel		Driver
Slave mode	no		no
Host notify	no		no
Block PEC	yes		yes
Hardware PEC	yes		yes


Other ICH4 and later Features
-----------------------------

The following additional features are also _not_ supported:

32 Byte buffer
