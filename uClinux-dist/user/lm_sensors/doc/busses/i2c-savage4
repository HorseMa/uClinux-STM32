Description
-----------

The Savage4 chips contain two I2C interfaces (aka a I2C 'master'
or 'host'). 

The first interface is used for DDC (Data Display Channel)
which is a serial channel through the VGA monitor connector
to a DDC-compliant monitor. This interface is defined by the
Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The standards
are available for purchase at http://www.vesa.org .
The DDC bus is not yet supported because its register is not
directly memory-mapped.

The second interface is a general-purpose I2C bus.
This is the only interface supported by the driver at the moment.

This driver uses the i2c-algo-bit module which must be
modprobed and/or enabled in your kernel
(Character Devices -> I2C Support -> I2C Bit-Banging Interfaces).
