Kernel driver `i2c-ipmi.o'

Status: Alpha

Supported adapters:
  * IPMI BMC

Author: Mark D. Studebaker <mdsxyz123@yahoo.com>


Module Parameters
-----------------
(none)


Description
-----------
This is a "dummy" adapter which provides access to the
BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) via IPMI (Intelligent Platform
Management Interface). It is used by the bmcsensors module.

Together with the bmcsensors module, this provides high-level
access to sensors known by the BMC. For low-level access to
IPMB (I2C/SMBus) busses behind the BMC, use the i2c-ipmb module.

This module REQUIRES the IPMI kernel patch by Corey Minyard,
v13 or higher, available at http://openipmi.sourceforge.net .
Other IPMI drivers are not supported.

See http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/ for
IPMI standards information.

You must configure the following features in your kernel
(under Character Devices):
	IPMI top-level message handler
	IPMI KCS handler
The IPMI device interface and IPMI watchdog handler are not required.

If the KCS handler (ipmi_kcs_drv) is configured as a module,
you must modprobe it separately, it will not load automatically
when you modprobe i2c-ipmi or ipmi_msghandler (unless you set up
/etc/modules.conf to load ipmi_kcs_drv when ipmi_msghandler is loaded).

Issues
------
Only one BMC is supported - shouldn't be a problem.

Only one client is supported - to be fixed.

Libsensors was hacked to support this dummy driver; only
the ISA dummy driver was supported previously.
The library needs further enhancements for full
dummy driver support.

Alpha!
