Kernel driver `i2c-ipmb.o'

Status: IN DEVELOPMENT - DOESN'T WORK AT ALL - DON'T BOTHER TRYING IT

Supported adapters:
  * IPMI BMC

Author: Mark D. Studebaker <mdsxyz123@yahoo.com>


Module Parameters
-----------------
(none)


Description
-----------
This is an adapter which provides access to the IPMB
(Intelligent Platform Management Bus) and other I2C / SMBus busses
behind the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) via
IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface).

This provides low-level access to all devices on busses
behind the BMC. For high-level access to sensors known
to the BMC, use the i2c-ipmi and bmcsensors modules.

This module REQUIRES the IPMI kernel patch by Corey Minyard,
v13 or higher, available at http://openipmi.sourceforge.net .
Other IPMI drivers are not supported.

See http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/ for
IPMI standards information.

You must configure the following features in your kernel
(under Character Devices):
	IPMI top-level message handler
	IPMI KCS handler
The IPMI device interface and IPMI watchdog handler are not required.

If the KCS handler (ipmi_kcs_drv) is configured as a module,
you must modprobe it separately, it will not load automatically
when you modprobe i2c-ipmi or ipmi_msghandler (unless you set up
/etc/modules.conf to load ipmi_kcs_drv when ipmi_msghandler is loaded).

Issues
------
Only one BMC is supported - shouldn't be a problem.

Alpha!
