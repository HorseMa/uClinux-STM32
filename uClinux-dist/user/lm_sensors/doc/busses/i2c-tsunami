Module Parameters
-----------------
(none)


Description
-----------
The Tsunami/Typhoon chipsets' "Cchip" supports I2C busses via MPD registers
and appropriate open drain pins. This bus is usually used to read 
SPD SDRAM DIMMs, however there may be other devices on
the bus also. These chips are used with wide range of 21264A boards.

This driver uses the i2c-algo-bit module which must be
modprobed and/or enabled in your kernel
(Character Devices -> I2C Support -> I2C Bit-Banging Interfaces).


Stability
---------
Apparently stable.

Supported Devices
-----------------
This driver was written and tested on the 'API UP2000(+)
boards'. As seems it should work with any Tsunami based system.

Features
--------
I2C busses use the i2c-algo-bit driver for 'bit banging' and support
for specific transactions is provided by i2c-algo-bit.

Issues
------
Not known.
