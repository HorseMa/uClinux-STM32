Description
-----------

i2c-via is an i2c bus driver for motherboards with VIA chipset.

The following VIA pci chipsets are supported:
 - MVP3, VP3, VP2/97, VPX/97 
 - others with South bridge VT82C586B

Your /proc/pci or lspci listing must show this :

 Bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B ACPI (rev 10)

To install this driver, simply do
  # modprobe i2c-via  

This driver uses the i2c-algo-bit module which must be
modprobed and/or enabled in your kernel
(Character Devices -> I2C Support -> I2C Bit-Banging Interfaces).

    Problems?
 
 Q: You have VT82C586B on the motherboard, but not in the listing. 
 
 A: Go to your BIOS setup, section PCI devices or similar.
    Turn USB support on, and try again. 

 Q: No error messages, but still i2c doesn't seem to work.

 A: This can happen. This driver uses the pins VIA recommends in their
    datasheets, but there are several ways the motherboard manufacturer
    can actually wire the lines.
