Module Parameters
-----------------
(none)


Description
-----------
This driver uses the i2c-algo-bit module which must be
modprobed and/or enabled in your kernel
(Character Devices -> I2C Support -> I2C Bit-Banging Interfaces).

WARNING: If you have an '810' or '815' motherboard, your standard I2C
temperature sensors are most likely on the 801's I2C bus.
You want the i2c-i801.o driver for those, not this driver.

Now for the i2c-i810...

The GMCH chip contains two I2C interfaces.

The first interface is used for DDC (Data Display Channel)
which is a serial channel through the VGA monitor connector
to a DDC-compliant monitor. This interface is defined by the
Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The standards
are available for purchase at http://www.vesa.org .

The second interface is a general-purpose I2C bus.
It may be connected to a TV-out chip such as the BT869 or possibly
to a digital flat-panel display.

Stability
---------
Apparently stable.


Supported Devices
-----------------
See above.
	

Features
--------
Both busses use the i2c-algo-bit driver for 'bit banging' and support
for specific transactions is provided by i2c-algo-bit.


Issues
------
If you enable bus testing in i2c-algo-bit (insmod i2c-algo-bit bit_test=1),
the test may fail; if so, the i2c-i810 driver won't be inserted.
However, we think this has been fixed.
