@section What sensors are available on my PC?

Most PC's built since late 1997 now come with a
hardware health monitoring chip. This chip may be accessed via the
ISA bus or the SMBus, depending on the motherboard.

Some motherboard chipsets, notably the Via 686 and the SiS 5595,
contain hardware monitor functions.

This FAQ frequently refers to the "LM78". This chip has been
obsoleted by National Semiconductor. Most motherboards today contain
a chip with similar functions.


@node Section 1.2, Section 1.3, Section 1.1, Overview
@section What can a sensor chip like the "LM78" do?

The LM78 is a chip made by National Semiconductor which can monitor 7
voltages (5 positive, 2 negative) from 0 to 4.08V.  The inputs are usually in
series with voltage dividers which lower the +/- 12V and +/- 5V supplies to
measurable range.  Therefore, the readings for such inputs need to be
re-scaled appropriately by software.

The LM78 also has 3 fan speed monitoring inputs, an internal
temperature sensor, a chassis intrusion sensor, and a couple maskable interrupt
inputs.  The LM78 can also relay the processor's (P6 or Pent II) VID lines
which are hardwired and used to indicate to the power regulator (usually on
the mainboard close to the processor socket/slot) what voltage to supply to
the processor.

The LM78 can be interfaced to a system via the ISA bus and/or the
SMBus.

Most other sensor chips have comparable functionality. Each supported
chip is documented in the @file{doc/chips} directory.


@node Section 1.3,  , Section 1.2, Overview
@section Where do I find out more about any of these chips?

Most semiconductor companies have comprehensive documentation,
including complete datasheets, on their websites. Analog Devices,
Dallas Semiconductor, Maxim, and National Semiconductor have the widest selection
of sensor chips. Their websites are:

@node Section 2.1, Section 2.2, , Basics
@section How are these sensors read?

Sensor chips reside on either the ISA bus, the SMBus, or both.
See the file @file{doc/chips/SUMMARY} in our package for a list.

To communicate with chips on the ISA bus, the software uses
simple I/O reads and writes.

To communicate with chips on the SMBus, the software must
use an SMBus interface device, explained below.


@node Section 2.2, Section 2.3, Section 2.1, Basics
@section What is the SMBus? And the I2C bus?

The SMBus is the "System Management Bus".  More specifically, it is a
2-wire, low-speed serial communication bus used for basic health monitoring
and hardware management. It is a specific implementation of the more
general I2C (pronunciation: I-squared-C) bus. In fact, both I2C devices
and SMBus devices may be connected to the same (I2C) bus.

The SMBus (or I2C bus) starts at the host controller, used for
starting transactions on the SMBus.  From the host interface, the
devices communicated with are the @dfn{slave} devices.  Each slave device has a
unique 7-bit address which the host uses to refer to that device.

For each supported SMBus host, there is a separate kernel module
which implements the communication protocol with the host. Some SMBus hosts
really operate on the SMBus level; these hosts can not cope with pure I2C
devices. Other hosts are in fact I2C hosts: in this case, we implement
the SMBus protocol in terms of I2C operations. But these hosts can also
talk to pure I2C devices.


@node Section 2.3, Section 2.4, Section 2.2, Basics
@section I don't have an ISA bus!

We promise, you do, even if you don't have any old ISA slots.
The "ISA Bus" exists in your computer even if you don't have ISA slots;
it is simply a memory-mapped area, 64KB in size (0x0000 - 0xFFFF)
where many "legacy" functions, such as keyboard and interrupt controllers,
are found. It isn't necessarily a separate physical bus.
See the file @file{/proc/ioports} for a list of devices living on
the "ISA Bus" in your system. If you don't like the term "ISA Bus"
think "I/O Space".


@node Section 2.4, Section 2.5, Section 2.3, Basics
@section What sensors do processors have?

Most new processors contain a thermal diode on the die itself.
The electical properties of all diodes and transistors vary
slightly with temperature. The thermal diode is exceptionally accurate
because it is directly on the die. Newer temperature sensor chips,
like the Analog Devices ADM1021 and clones, and the Winbond chips,
have circuitry for measuring the the electrical properties of
an external diode and converting this data to a temperature.
Any sensor chip listed in @file{doc/chips/SUMMARY} in our package which
has support for more than one temperature supports external temperature sensing.

Older motherboards and processors without this feature generally use
an LM75 placed close to the processor. This is much less accurate.

The Pentium 2 'boxed' processor usually has an LM75 very close to the
base of the box. It can be read through the SMBus to report the approximate
temperature of the processor.  The processor also contains an internal
temperature sensor (of low accuracy) used as a fail-safe to disable the
processor in case it gets much too hot (usually around 130 degrees C).  And,
the Pentium 2 also has a hard-wired signal (VID lines) on it's SEC (single
edge connector) which indicates what power supply is required to operate the
processor.

The P6 (Pentium-Pro) may have an LM75 in or just under the socket.
P6's also have VID lines.

Pentiums and Pentium w/ MMX do not have VID lines, and sometimes have
LM75's under the sockets (depends on the mainboard, and how 'modern' the
mainboard is).

The P2 Xeon was the first Intel processor to include the SMBus
interface on the P2 Xeon SEC.


@node Section 2.5, Section 2.6, Section 2.4, Basics
@section How often are the sensor values updated?

The LM78, and most other sensor chips like it, reads its sensors one
by one. A complete scanning sweep will take about 1.5 seconds. The LM78 stops
readings sensors if you try to access it, so if you access it very often
(by reading sensor values; writing new limits is safe) it will not find the
time to update its sensor values at all! Fortunately, the kernel module takes
care not to do this, and only reads new values each 1.5 seconds. If you
read the values again, you will get the 'old' values again.


@node Section 2.6, , Section 2.5, Basics
@section How are alarms triggered?

It is possible to monitor each sensor and have an alarm go off if
it crosses some pre-determined limits.  There are two sorts of interrupts
which can be generated by sensor chips if this happens (it depends a bit on
the actual chip if both are supported; the LM80, for example, has only
IRQ interrupts): IRQ interrupts and SMI interrupts.  IRQ stands for
Interrupt Request and are the interrupt lines you can find in @file{/proc/interrupts}.
SMI stands for System Management Interrupt, and is a special interrupt which
puts the processor in a secure environment independent of any other things
running.  SMI is currently not supported by the Linux kernel.  IRQs are
supported, of course.

Even if no interrupt is generated, some bits in a status register
will be set until the register is read the next time. If the alarm condition
persists after that, the bits will be set on the next scanning sweep, etc.

Most drivers in our package do not support interrupts at this time.

@section Why so many modules, and how do I cope with them?

We tried to make this package as modular as possible. This makes it
easy to add new drivers, and unused drivers will take no precious kernel
space. On the other hand, it can be a bit confusing at first.

Here are two simple guidelines:
@itemize
  @item Run @command{sensors-detect} and do what it tells you.
  @item Always use @command{modprobe}, not @command{insmod}.
@end itemize

Further information is in @file{doc/modules}.


@anchor{How do I know which chips I own}
@node Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.1, Installation
@section How do I know which chips I own?

We have an excellent program that scans all your hardware.
It is called @file{sensors-detect} and is installed in @file{/usr/local/sbin}
by @command{make install}. Just execute this script, and it will tell you.

Chip detection in the drivers is fairly good. That means that it is
usually harmless to insert more chip drivers than you need. However, this
can still lead to problems, so we do not recommend it.

If sensors-detect didn't find any sensors, either you don't have
any, or the ones you have, we don't support. (Look at your motherboard
for candidates, then @pxref{Help})


@anchor{Section 3.2.1}
@subsection What chips are on motherboard XYZ?

    @strong{!!!!!!!!! YES THIS IS THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTION WE GET !!!!!!!!!}

We have no idea. Here is what you should do:
@enumerate
  @item Run sensors-detect.
@end enumerate

If that doesn't work:
@enumerate 2
@item Look at your motherboard.
@item Check the manufacturer's website or ask their support
@item Check the @uref{http://mbm.livewiredev.com/, Motherboard Monitor} website and the

page on @uref{http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/, our website} some good cross-references.
@end enumerate

We don't support boards, we support chips. @xref{Section 3.2.1, What chips are on motherboard XYZ}.

@node Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.2, Installation
@section Which modules should I insert?

@command{sensors-detect} will tell you. Take the @command{modprobe} lines it
recommends and paste them into the appropriate @file{/etc/rc.d/xxxx} file
to be executed at startup.

You need one module for each sensor chip and bus adapter you own;
if there are sensor chips on the ISA bus, you also need @file{i2c-isa.o}.
for each type of chip you own. That's all. On my computer, I could use the
following lines:
@itemize
@item @command{modprobe i2c-isa}
@item @command{modprobe i2c-piix4}
@item @command{modprobe lm78}
@item @command{modprobe lm75}
@item @command{modprobe i2c-dev}
@item @command{sensors -s}
@end itemize


@node Section 3.4, Section 3.5, Section 3.3, Installation
@section Do I need the configuration file @file{/etc/sensors.conf}?

Yes, for any applications that use @file{libsensors,} including the
@command{sensors} application included in our package.
It tells libsensors how to translate the values the chip
measures to real-world values. This is especially important for voltage
inputs. The default configuration file should usually do the trick.
It is automatically installed as @file{/etc/sensors.conf}, but it will not
overwrite any existing file with that name.


@anchor{Section 3.4.1}
@subsection The labels for the voltage and temperature readings in @command{sensors} are incorrect!

Every motherboard is different. You can customize the labels
in the file @file{/etc/sensors.conf}. That's why it exists!
The default labelling (in @file{lib/chips.c} and @file{/etc/sensors.conf}) is just
a template.


@anchor{Section 3.4.2}
@subsection The min and max for the readings in @command{sensors} are incorrect!

You can customize them in the file @file{/etc/sensors.conf}. See above.


@anchor{Section 3.4.3}
@subsection The min and max settings in @file{/etc/sensors.conf} didn't take effect!

You forgot to run @command{sensors -s}. See above.


@anchor{Section 3.4.4}
@subsection One sensor isn't hooked up on my board!

Use an @command{ignore} line in @file{/etc/sensors.conf} so it isn't
displayed in @command{sensors}.


@anchor{Section 3.4.5}
@subsection I need help with @file{sensors.conf}!

There is detailed help at the top of that file.


@anchor{Section 3.4.6}
@subsection Do you have a database of @file{sensors.conf} entries for specific boards?

No. Good idea though. If you would like to set one up on your website
send us mail and we will set up a link to it.


@node Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.4, Installation
@section What about the @samp{No such file or directory} warnings when I compile?

Don't worry about them. The dependency files (which tell which
files should be recompiled when certain files change) are created
dynamically. They are not distributed with the package. The @command{make} program
notices they are not there, and warns about that - and the first thing
it will do is generate them. So all is well.


@node Section 3.6, Section 3.7, Section 3.5, Installation
@section I get all kinds of weird compilation errors?

Check that the correct i2c header files are used. Depending on
how you installed, they should be under either @file{/usr/local/include} or
@file{/usr/src/linux*/include}. Try to edit the @file{Makefile} for the other setting.


@anchor{Section 3.6.1}
@subsection @samp{No rule to make target xxxx needed by xxxx} - how to fix?

@itemize
@item @xref{Section 3.6, I get all kinds of weird compilation errors}, also try @command{make clean} in @file{lm_sensors}.
@item If that doesn't work, try @command{make clean} in @file{i2c}.
@item If that doesn't work, try @command{make clean} in the kernel.
@item Also make sure @file{/usr/include/linux} points to @file{/usr/src/linux/include/linux}.
@end itemize


@node Section 3.7, Section 3.8, Section 3.6, Installation
@section It still does not compile or patch!

Have you installed the matching version of the i2c package? Remember,
compilation is not enough, you also need to install it for the header
files to be found!

If you want to patch the kernel, you will have to apply the i2c
patches first!


@node Section 3.8, Section 3.9, Section 3.7, Installation
@section @command{make install} fails on Mandrake kernels

Mandrake uses a non-standard @file{version.h} file which confuses our @file{Makefile}.
Edit our @file{Makefile} on the @code{MODDIR :=} line to hard-code the module directory.


@node Section 3.9, Section 3.10, Section 3.8, Installation
@section I get unresolved symbols when I @command{modprobe} modules (Red Hat especially)

Example:
@example
*** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.5/kernel/drivers/i2c/i2c-i810.o
i2c_bit_add_bus_R8c3bc60e
i2c_bit_del_bus_R92b18f49
@end example

You can also run @command{depmod -a -e} to see all unresolved symbols.


These are module versioning problems. Generally you did not compile
against the kernel you are running. Sometimes the Red Hat source you
have is not for the kernel you are running.
You must compile our package against the source for the kernel you
are running with something like @command{make LINUX=/usr/src/linux-2.4.14}.


Try the following to be sure:

@itemize
@item @command{nm --extern MODULE.o}
Filter out the kernel symbols, like @code{kmalloc}, @code{printk} etc. and note the
number code behind them, like @code{printk_R1b7d4074}. If there is no numeric
code after them, note this too.
@item @command{grep SYMBOL /proc/ksyms}
Substitute SYMBOL by the basename of the symbols above, like @code{kmalloc},
@code{printk} etc. Note the number code behind them, or the lack thereof.
@item Compare both sets of symbols. Are they the same? If so, the problem
lies somewhere else. Are they different? If so, you have a module
versioning problem.
@end itemize


@node Section 3.10, , Section 3.9, Installation
@section I2C_DRIVERID_ADM1024 undefined (Red Hat especially)

In some versions of Redhat, an RPM is included to provide i2c support.
However, this RPM does not place the header files in the kernel directory
structure.  When you update kernels, they may persist.  To get rid of
these obsolete header files, at a command prompt:

@enumerate
@item @command{rpm -qa | grep i2c}
@item Look for @file{kernel-i2c,} or a similar rpm in the output
@item <as root>
@command{rpm -ev kernel-i2c} (or the name of the similar package)
If this complains about dependencies, you can try adding
@command{--nodeps}, but this *MAY* break something else.  Not likely,
as you have upgraded kernels, and nothing should be using the
old i2c stuff anymore anyway.  Just don't use it with abandon.
@item Try (in the build directory of @file{lm_sensors)}
@example
@command{make clean}
@command{make}
@end example
@item @emph{If} you still have problems, you may have to replace the include
paths in the @file{.c/.h} files with absolute paths to the header files.
More of a workaround than a real fix, but at least you can get it
to work.

@section My fans report exactly half/double their values compared to the BIOS?

The problem with much of the sensor data is that it is impossible to
properly interpret some of the readings without knowing what the hardware
configuration is.  Some fans report one 'tick' each rotation, some report
two 'ticks' each rotation. It is easy to resolve this through the
configuration file @file{/etc/sensors.conf}:

@example
chip lm78-*             # Or whatever chip this relates to
compute fan1 2*@@,@@/2    # This will double the fan1 reading
                        # -- or --
compute fan1 @@/2,2*@@    # This will halve the fan1 reading
@end example

See @file{doc/fan-divisors} in our package for further information.


@anchor{Fans sometimes/always read 0!}
@subsection Fans sometimes/always read 0!!

You may not have a three-wire fan, which is required.

You may need to increase the 'fan divisor'. See @file{doc/fan-divisors}
in our package for further information.


@anchor{I doubled the fan divisor and the fan still reads 7000}
@subsection I doubled the fan divisor and the fan still reads 7000!

Believe it or not, doubling the 'fan divisor' will not halve
the fan reading. You have to add a compute line in @file{/etc/sensors.conf}.
@xref{Section 4.1, My fans report exactly half/double their values compared to the BIOS},
and see @file{doc/fan-divisors} in our package for further information.


@node Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.1, Problems
@section Why do my two LM75's report "-48 degrees"?

For starters, those aren't LM75's.  Your mainboard actually has the
Winbond W83781D which emulates two LM75's, but many systems which use the
Winbond chip (such as the Asus P2B) don't have the thermo-resisters connected
to the chip resulting in these strange -48 degree readings.

In upcoming versions, you will be able to disable non-interesting
readings.


@node Section 4.3, Section 4.4, Section 4.2, Problems
@section Why do I have two Vcore readings, I have only one processor!

The LM78 has seven voltage sensors. The default way of
connecting them is used in the configuration file. This includes a VCore2,
even if you do not have one. You can easily edit the configuration file
to give it another name, or make this reading disappear using
an @command{ignore} line.

Note that Vcore2 is often the same as Vcore on motherboards which
only support one processor. Another possibility is that Vcore2 is not
connected at all and will not have a valid reading at all.
A third possibility, is that Vcore2 monitors something
else, so you should not be too surprised if the values are completely
different.


@node Section 4.4, Section 4.5, Section 4.3, Problems
@section How do those ALARMS work? The current value is within range but there is still an ALARM warning!

The ALARM indications in @command{sensors} are those reported by the
sensor chip itself. They are NOT calculated by @command{sensors}. @command{sensors}
simply reads the ALARM bits and reports them.

An ALARM will go off when a minimum or maximum limit is crossed.
The ALARM is then latched - that is, it will stay there until the
chip's registers are next accessed - which will be the next time
you read these values, but not within (usually) 1.5 seconds since the last

Reading the registers clears the ALARMS, unless the current
value is still out of range.

The purpose of this scheme is to tell you if there has been
a problem and report it to the user. Voltage or temperature spikes
get detected without having to read the sensor chip hundreds of times
a second. The implemetation details depend a bit on the kind of chip.
See the specific chip documentation in @file{doc/chips} and the
chip datasheet for more information.

@section My voltage readings seem to drift a bit. Is something wrong?

No, probably not. If your motherboard heats up a bit, the sensed
voltages will drift a bit. If your power supply is loaded (because a disk
gets going, for example), the voltages may get a bit lower. Heavy
processor activity, in particular, dramatically increases core voltage
supply load which will often cause variation in the other supplies.
As long as they stay within a sensible range (say 5% of the nominal value
for CPU core voltages, and 10% for other voltages), there is no
reason to worry.


@node Section 4.6, Section 4.7, Section 4.5, Problems
@section Some measurements are way out of range. What happened?

Each module tries to set limits to sensible values on initialization,
but a module does not know how a chip is actually connected. This is
described in the configuration file, which is not read by kernel modules.
So limits can be strange, if the chip is connected in a non-standard way.

Readings can also be strange; there are several reasons for this.
Temperature sensors, for example, can simply not be present, even though
the chip supports them. Also, it can be that the input is used in a
non-standard way. You can use the configuration file to describe how this
measurement should be interpreted; see the comments the example file for
more information.

@anchor{-5V and -12V readings are way out of range!}
@subsection -5V and -12V readings are way out of range!

It's very frequent that negative voltage lines are not wired because
motherboard manufacturers don't think they're worth monitoring
(they are mostly unused these days). You can just add
@command{ignore inN} lines to @file{/etc/sensors.conf} to hide them.

Another possibility is that these lines are used to monitor different
voltages. Only the motherboard manufacturer can tell for sure. Taking
a look at what voltage values the BIOS displays may provide valuable
hints though.


@node Section 4.7, Section 4.8, Section 4.6, Problems
@section What are VID lines? Why is the VID reading wrong?

These describe the core voltage for your processor. They are
supported for most processors, however they are not always
correctly connected to the sensor chip, so the readings may be invalid.
A reading of 0V, +3.5V or +2.05V is especially suspect.
If this is the case, add a line @command{ignore vid} to @file{/etc/sensors.conf},
and change the min and max settings for the Processor Core voltage
(often in0_min and in0_max) in that file so that they don't depend on vid.

The CPU nominal voltage is computed from VID lines according to a formula
that depends on the CPU type. Most chips that report a VID value can be
configured to use either VRM 8.2 (for Pentium III) or VRM 9.0 (for Pentium 4
and Athlon). You chose which one you want through @file{/etc/sensors.conf}.
See @file{doc/vid} for more information.

@section I read sensor values several times a second, but they are only updated only each second or so. Why?

If we would read the registers more often, it would not find the
time to update them. So we only update our readings once each 1.5 seconds
(the actual delay is chip-specific; for some chips, it may not be needed
at all).


@node Section 4.9, Section 4.10, Section 4.8, Problems
@section It sometimes seems to take almost a second before I see the sensor reading results. Why?

ISA bus access is fast, but SMBus access is really slow. If you have
a lot of sensors, it just takes a lot of time to access them. Fortunately,
this has almost no impact on the system as a whole, as another job can run
while we are waiting for the transaction to finish.


@node Section 4.10, Section 4.11, Section 4.9, Problems
@section Can I be alerted when an ALARM occurs?

No, you can't; and it may well be never supported.

Almost no mainboard we have encountered have actually connected the
IRQ-out pin of sensor chips. That means that we could enable IRQ reporting, but
nothing would happen. Also, even if a motherboard has it connected, it is
unclear what interrupt number would be triggered. And IRQ lines are a scarce
facility, which means that almost nobody would be able to use it anyway.

The SMI interrupt is only available on a few types of chips. It is
really a very obscure way to handle interrupts, and supporting it under Linux
might be quite hard to do.

Your best bet would be to poll the alarm file with a user-land daemon
which alerts you if an alarm is raised. I am not aware of any program which
does the job, though you might want to examine one of the graphical monitor
programs under X, see @uref{http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/useful_addresses.html} for addresses.

@section SMBus transactions on my PIIX4 simply don't work (timeouts happen).  Why?

Some chips which mainboard makers connect to the SMBus are not SMBus
devices.  An example is the 91xx clock generator chips.  When read, these
devices can lock up the SMBus until the next hard reboot.  This is because
they have a similar serial interface (like the I2C), but don't conform to
Intel's SMBus standard.

Why did they connect these devices to the SMBus if they aren't
compatible?  Good question! :')  Actually, these devices may support being
written to, but lock things up when they are read.


@node Section 4.12, Section 4.13, Section 4.11, Problems
@section My BIOS reports a much higher CPU temperature than your modules!

We display the actual temperature of the sensor. This may not be the
temperature you are interested in, though.  If a sensor should measure
the CPU temperature, it must be in thermal contact with it.  In practice,
it may be just somewhere nearby. Your BIOS may correct for this (by adding,
for example, thirty degrees to the measured temperature).  The correction
factor is regrettably different for each mainboard, so we can not do this
in the module itself. You can do it through the configuration file, though:

@example
chip lm75-*-49                      # Or whatever chip this relates to
label temp "Processor"
compute temp @@*1.2+13,(@@-13)/1.2    # Or whatever formula
@end example

However, the offset you are introducing might not be necessary. If you
tried to have Linux idle temperature and BIOS "idle" temperature match,
you may be misguided.
We have a Supermicro (370DLE) motherboard and we know
that its BIOS has a closed, almost undelayed while(1) loop that
keeps the CPU busy all the time. Linux reads 26 degrees idle, BIOS reads
38 degrees. Linux at full load is in the 35-40 degrees range so this
makes sense.

Yes, this is still a problem. It is partially solved by alias detection
and confidence values in sensors-detect, but it is really tough.

Double detections can be caused by two things:
sensors can be detected to both the ISA and the SMBus (and if you have
loaded the approprate adapter drivers, it will be detected on both), and
some chips simulate other chips (the Winbond W83781D simulates LM75 chips
on the SMBus, for example). Remove the offending adapter or chip driver, or
run sensors-detect and add the @command{ignore=} modprobe parameters it suggests.


@node Section 4.16, Section 4.17, Section 4.15, Problems
@section I ran sensors-detect, but now I get very strange readings?!?

Your SMBus (PIIX4?) is probably crashed or hung. There are some mainboards

hangs the PIIX4 if it is read (it is an I2C device, but not SMBus compatible).
We have found no way of solving this, except for rebooting your computer.

@subsection Where are my EEPROMs?
The 2.6.14-rc1 kernel introduced the hwmon class, which groups all
hardware monitoring drivers in a logical way. The goal was to help
libsensors grab the relevant sensors information in /sys. In particular:
@itemize
@item libsensors will no more need to know about the underlying bus types
(I2C/SMBus, ISA or other);
@item libsensors will no more list non-hardware monitoring chips.
@end itemize
This explains why EEPROMs are no more displayed by @command{sensors}:
they are no hardware monitoring chips. The medium term plan is to drop
eeprom support for all Linux 2.6 kernels, as it didn't fit well in
the library code in the first place.

Note that you can still obtain information about your EEPROMs by using
the dedicated perl scripts in @file{prog/eeprom}: @command{ddcmon},
@command{decode-dimms.pl}, @command{decode-edid.pl} and
@command{decode-vaio.pl}.

@section What to send us when asking for help

We are always willing to answer questions if things don't work out.
Post your question to our @uref{http://lists.lm-sensors.org/mailman/listinfo/lm-sensors, discussion list},
and not the individual authors,
unless you have something private to say.

Instead of using email, you can also use the web-based support
area, at @uref{http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/support.html}. You will be helped
just as fast, and others may profit from the answer too. You will be
emailed automatically when your question has been answered.

Here's what you should send us:

@itemize
@item The dmesg or syslog output if applicable
@item The output of (as root) @command{prog/detect/sensors-detect}
@item The output of @command{lsmod}
@item If a PCI chip problem:
@itemize
@item The output of @command{lspci -n}
@end itemize
@item If an I2C sensor chip problem:
@itemize
@item The output of (as root) @command{prog/detect/i2cdetect X}
where X = the bus number (run @command{i2cdetect} with no arguments to list the busses)
(please send this only if it's not all @samp{XX})
@item The output of (as root) @command{prog/dump/i2cdump X 0xXX}
where XX = the address of each chip you see in the output of @command{i2cdetect}. (run once for each chip)
(please send this only if it's not all @samp{ff})
@end itemize
@item If an ISA sensor chip problem:
@itemize
@item The output of (as root) @command{prog/dump/isadump 0x295 0x296} (only if it's not all @samp{XX})
@end itemize
@item Part numbers of chips on your motherboard you think are the sensor chips (look at your motherboard)
@item Motherboard type
@item Sensors version
@item Kernel version
@end itemize


@node Section 5.2, Section 5.3, Section 5.1, Help
@section What to do if a module won't insert?

Did you use @command{modprobe} instead of @command{insmod}??? Don't use insmod.

Were there unresolved symbols? Did you run @command{depmod -a}? Run
@command{depmod -a -e} to see where the symbol problem is.

ALWAYS inspect the output of @command{dmesg}. That's where the error
messages come out!!! Don't rely on the generic message from @command{modprobe}.
If you still can't figure it out, send us the information
listed above.


@node Section 5.3, Section 5.4, Section 5.2, Help
@section What to do if it inserts, but nothing happens?

For an ISA sensor chip, did you also @command{modprobe i2c-isa}? It must be inserted.

For an I2C sensor chip, did you also @command{modprobe i2c-xxx} where xxx is your
I2C bus adapter? It must be inserted.

Always inspect the output of @command{dmesg}. That's where the error
messages come out. If you still can't figure it out, send us the information
listed above.


@node Section 5.4, Section 5.5, Section 5.3, Help
@section What to do if I read only bogus information?

It may be that this was a mis-detection: the chip may not be
present. If you are convinced there is something wrong, verify that you
indeed have the devices on your motherboard that you think you do.
Look at the motherboard and make sure. If you are still stuck,
please send us the usual information (@pxref{Help})


@node Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Section 5.4, Help
@section What to do if you have other problems?

Again, send the output listed above.


@node Section 5.6, Section 5.7, Section 5.5, Help
@section What if it just works like a charm?

Drop us a mail if you feel like it, mentioning the mainboard and
detected chip type. That way, we have some positive feedback, too!

@section How do I update a ticket?

You can't. Only developers can. Follow up by emailing us

@section How do I follow up on a ticket?

Follow up by emailing us
and reference your ticket number in the subject.


@node Section 5.9, , Section 5.8, Help
@section Why did you decide not to support undocumented chips?

There are several reasons why we are generally not interested in writing
drivers for undocumented chips:

@itemize
@item Writing a driver without a datasheet is much harder, as you have to
guess most things. Remember that, most of the time, we write drivers for fun
and for free, so there is no reason we would write a driver in conditions
that promise more pain than fun.
@item If we hit a problem, we are certain never to get any support from the
chip manufacturer. This means that we may spend days on code which will
finally never work.
@item There are several chips out there which are fully documented and lack
a driver. This is natural for us to give these the priority when we
finally have some spare time to spend on driver coding.
@item Hardware monitoring chips are not toys. Misprogramming them can
result in data loss or hardware breakage. This is obviously more likely
to happen with undocumented chips. This is a responsability we do not
want to endorse (the GPL is pretty clear than we are not legally
liable, but still).
@end itemize

There are also several reasons why we do not want to support such drivers,
even if they were written by other people:

@itemize
@item Problems are much more likely to happen with such drivers.
This means increased needs of support. User support if very
time-consuming and we are usually short of time.
@item Support should be done by the driver author (as only him/her knows
the driver and chip) but in the reality of facts, people will always ask
us for help if the driver is part of our package. Redirecting all user
requests to the driver's author manually is boring.
@item The lack of datasheet usually results in an original driver which
works relatively fine for its author, but will happen not to work
completely for other users. This means that the driver will need many
more additions and fixes than other drivers do, resulting in an increased
maitainance workload, which we can hardly afford. Of course this too should
be handled by the original driver author, but we never know whether he/she
will actually do the work.
@end itemize

Lastly, there are other considerations, some of which are deliberately
political:

@itemize
@item We do not want to trick hardware buyers into thinking that a chip is
fully supported under Linux when in fact it is only partly supported by a
driver which was written without a datasheet. Clearly stating that such
chips are not supported makes it much easier for anyone who really needs
fully working hardware monitoring under Linux to avoid motherboards with
these partly supported chips.
@item Drivers written without a datasheet are a pain for developers and
users, but are a complete win for the manufacturers of these chips:
they don't have to write the driver, they don't have to help us,
they don't have to support the users, and they still sell their
hardware. We do not want to encourage such a selfish behavior.
@end itemize

That being said, authors of such drivers can still submit their code to
the Linux kernel folks for inclusion into Linux 2.6. Their driver may be
accepted there, under conditions.

If such a driver is ever accepted into the Linux 2.6 tree, and someone
provides a patch to libsensors and/or sensors to add support for this
driver, we will apply it. This generic code is unlikely to cause trouble.
