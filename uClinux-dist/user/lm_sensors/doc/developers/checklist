CHECKLIST FOR NEW RELEASES
==========================

release:
- check out i2c and lm_sensors2
- Update if necessary, the version number of libsensors
  (edit lib/Module.mk and change LIBMAINVER and/or LIBMINORVER)
  Remember: update main number when interface changes, minor if new
  functionality is added, and patch if only bugs are fixed.
  `cvs diff -r Vx-y-z lib' is your friend.
- Update both CHANGES files (add the release date)
- Verify i2c dependency instructions in README, QUICKSTART, and INSTALL,
  update if necessary
- Update lm_sensors.lsm and send it to the LSM by mailing it to 
  lsm@execpc.com with the subject `add' (no quotes).
- update lm_sensors2/version.h and i2c/kernel/i2c.h, and cvs commit it
- Tag the release using CVS ('cvs tag V#-#-#' from the dist root)
- remove empty directories (e.g. rmdir `find . -type d`)
- remove 'CVS' related files/directories (e.g. rm -fR `find . -name CVS`)
- rename i2c and lm_sensors2 to i2c-#.#.# and lm_sensors-#.#.#
- tar it up and post it (sign it!)

misc:
- copy to mirrors
- announce on Freshmeat
- clear support area of unanswered tickets
- Add "-CVS" back to version consts in cvs, and ???? for dates
- prep CHANGES files for next release
