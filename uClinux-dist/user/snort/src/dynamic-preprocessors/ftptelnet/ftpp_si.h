 * Description:
 *
 * This file contains structures and functions for the
 * Session Inspection Module.
 *
 * The Session Inspection Module has several data structures that are
 * very important to the functionality of the module.  The two major
 * structures are the FTPP_SESSION and the FTPP_SI_INPUT.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - 20.09.04:  Initial Development.  SAS
