 * @brief  Easily allow modules to have a gettimeofday() based on packet time
 * 
 * In many modules in snort, especially the rate detectors need to
 * work based off time values.  It's very hard to reproduce time
 * constraints via pcap readbacks so we either have to throttle snort
 * or use the packet time.  I choose the latter.
