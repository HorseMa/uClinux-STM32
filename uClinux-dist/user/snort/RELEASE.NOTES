2007-05-09 - Snort 2.6.1.5 Released
[*] New Additions
    * Updated HttpInspect to normalize parameters that are part of the
      client request body in the same way it normalizes HTTP URIs.
      Added a modifier keyword to be used in conjunction with a content
      option in the rules to search only the normalized HTTP client request
      body.  Also added stats for HttpInspect to track number of various
      types of normalizations and HTTP methods.

[*] Improvements
    * Fix header files to avoid conflicts with system files on BSD for
      IPv6 data structures.

    * Fix possible memory leak in Stream4 when HttpInspect is being
      used.

2007-03-26 - Snort 2.6.1.4 Released
[*] New Additions
    * Added detection for BSD IPv6 fragmentation overflow (CVE-2007-1365).
      New options configure the behavior of the detection and new decoder
      alerts for truncated IPv6 headers and a Fragmentation alert for the 
      specific overflow attack.

[*] Security Improvements
    * Updated code to use safer functions that perform bounds checking
      when doing string or memory copies and snprintf buffer writes.
      Ensure null termination on string buffers and perform initialization
      on memory allocations.

2007-02-18 - Snort 2.6.1.3 Released
[*] Improvements
    * Updated DCE/RPC dynamic protocol normalizer to perform additional
      boundary checking when reassembling SMB fragments.  This addresses
      a potential remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overflow.

    * Updated Frag3 to protect against potential for fragments without
      ethernet header being passed from iptables to Snort inline.

2006-12-07 - Snort 2.6.1.2 Released
[*] Improvements
    * Fixed problem with snort using high CPU and potentially reprocessing
      the same TCP reassembled packets with a sequence number wrap and
      packets missing from the queue (out of order, dropped, or async
      network).

    * Updated DCE/RPC dynamic protocol normalizer to protect against
      integer underflow conditions.

    * Updated unified output plugin to work correctly on certain 64bit
      platforms where timeval structure is a different size.  A patch
      to barnyard that is associated with this fix can be found at:
      http://secure.lv/~nikns/stuff/barnyard_64bit.diff.

2006-11-22 - Snort 2.6.1.1 Released
[*] Improvements
    * Fixed problem with snort using high CPU and potentially reprocessing
      the same TCP reassembled packets at session end or TCP ACK of only
      part of a packet.

2006-11-16 - Snort 2.6.1 Released
[*] New Additions
    * Support for UDP "session" tracking to Stream4.  Enable via
      --enable-stream4udp option to configure script.  This allows
      the use of flow option with UDP rules.  Includes tracking
      of stats for UDP sessions.  A session is created for rules that
      use the flow or flowbits keywords.  Also provided the ability to
      ignore UDP any any -> any any rules as a performance improvement.

    * Stream5 (for Beta testing) as replacement for Stream4
      and Flow preprocessors.  See README.stream for details.

    * Allow blocking of entire session in inline mode via stream API.
      All subsequent packets on that session are blocked.

    * Dynamic DCE/RPC protocol normalizer and defragmentation
      module.  See README.dcerpc for details.

    * SSH (for Beta testing) protocol analyzer.  See README.ssh for
      details.

    * Support for GRE encapsulated protocol (experimental).  Enable via
      --enable-gre option to configure script.
    
    * Aruba networks output plugin (experimental).  See README.ARUBA for
      details.  Enable via --enable-aruba option to configure script.

    * Smaller memory footprint pattern mattcher using Aho-Corasick,
      using NFA.  Use 'config detection: search-method ac-bnfa' to 
      enable.  This will become the default pattern matcher in future
      releases.  Wu-Manhber has been deprecated (mwm).

[*] Improvements

    * Added parameter to dynamicengine to allow specification of
      directory instead of implicit file.  This will load all engine shared
      libraries within the specified directory.  Can also use
      --dynamic-engine-lib-dir command-line option.  Fix handling of
      loading multiple instances of the same dynamic library (engine,
      detection, or preprocessor).

    * Updates to HTTP inspect to handle different versions of IIS with
      the related iis profiles.  See README.httpinspect for details.

    * Cleaned up inline initialization to better handle test mode.

    * Updates to interface dependent variable definitions.

    * Added stats for packets not yet processed -- those that are still in
      the buffer used by pcap.

    * Fixed issue with fewer alerts being generated when snort is compiled
      with gcc 4.x by using no-strict-aliasing flag.

    * Require each rule to have a unique sid/gid pair.
