README for Asterisk Addons
==========================

This package contains additional modules for Asterisk which are, for one reason 
or another, not included in the normal base distribution.  Many of these
modules are experimental.

Notes: 

1) Using res_config_mysql at the same time as res_config_odbc can create
system instability on some systems.  Please load only one or the other.

2) format_mp3 can cause Asterisk to crash on certain mp3 files (notably
8k files made with lame) due to bugs in mpglib.  If you must use this 
module, use it only with mp3's you know will work with it.
