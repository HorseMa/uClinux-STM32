.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-pe\fR
PE stands for Portable Executable \- it's an executable file format used in all 32\-bit versions of Windows operating systems. By default ClamAV performs deeper analysis of executable files and attempts to decompress popular executable packers such as UPX, Petite, and FSG. This option \fBdisables\fR PE support and should be used with care!

.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-files=#n\fR
Extract at most #n files from each scanned file (when this is an archive, a document or another kind of container). This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 10000)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-filesize=#n\fR
Extract and scan at most #n kilobytes from each archive. You may pass the value in megabytes in format xM or xm, where x is a number. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 25 MB)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-scansize=#n\fR
Extract and scan at most #n kilobytes from each scanned file. You may pass the value in megabytes in format xM or xm, where x is a number. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 100 MB)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-recursion=#n\fR

\fB\-\-max\-dir\-recursion=#n\fR
Maximum depth directories are scanned at (default: 15).
.TP 
\fB\-\-unzip[=FULLPATH]\fR
In most cases you don't need this option \- the built\-in unarchiver will extract Zip archives. Howvere, this option may be used as a backup for internal unpacker \- see the full documentation for more information. When enabled without an argument, unzip program will be searched in $PATH. If unzip cannot be found in $PATH, you must force it with =pathname. Remember about '=' between the option and the argument.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unrar[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .rar files. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
.TP 
\fB\-\-arj[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .arj files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unzoo[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .zoo files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-lha[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .lzh files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-jar[=FULLPATH]\fR
clamscan uses unzip for .jar files, so in some cases you may need to pass a full path to unzip. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
.TP 
\fB\-\-deb[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports debian binary packages. Implies \-\-tgz, but doesn't conflict with \-\-tgz=FULLPATH. It requires ar utility.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tar[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports non\-compressed tar archives. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tgz[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports tar.gz and .tgz files. You need GNU tar, on non\-Linux system you probably have it installed as gtar. If it's in $PATH, please use \-\-tgz=gtar in other case please pass a full path. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
