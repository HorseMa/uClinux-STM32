.TP 
\fB\-\-detect\-structured\fR
Enable the DLP (Data Loss Prevention) module which provides detection of SSN and Credit Card numbers.
.TP 
\fB\-\-structured\-ssn\-format=X\fR
X=0: search for valid SSNs formatted as xxx-yy-zzzz (normal); X=1: search for valid SSNs formatted as xxxyyzzzz (stripped); X=2: search for both formats. Default is 0.
.TP 
\fB\-\-structured\-ssn\-count=#n\fR

Disable url-based heuristic phishing detection. This disables Phishing.Heuristics.Email.*
.TP
\fB\-\-heuristic\-scan\-precedence\fR
Allow heuristic match to take precedence. When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected  virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first,  the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
.TP
\fB\-\-phishing\-ssl\fR
Always block SSL mismatches in URLs (might lead to false positives!).
.TP
\fB\-\-phishing\-cloak\fR
Always block cloaked URLs (might lead to some false positives).
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-algorithmic\fR
In some cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files, and others), ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide accurate detection. This option disables the algorithmic detection.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-pe\fR
PE stands for Portable Executable \- it's an executable file format used in all 32\-bit versions of Windows operating systems. By default ClamAV performs deeper analysis of executable files and attempts to decompress popular executable packers such as UPX, Petite, and FSG. This option \fBdisables\fR PE support and should be used with care!
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-elf\fR
Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X executables. This option \fBdisables\fR ELF support.

.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-files=#n\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-filesize=#n\fR
