clamd \- an anti\-virus daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
clamd [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP 
clamd recognizes the following commands:

.TP 
\fBPING\fR
Check the server's state. It should reply with "PONG".
.TP 
\fBVERSION\fR
Print program and database versions.
.TP 
\fBRELOAD\fR
Reload the virus databases.
.TP 
\fBSHUTDOWN\fR
Perform a clean exit.
.TP 
\fBSCAN file/directory\fR
Scan a file or a directory (recursively) with archive support enabled (if not disabled in clamd.conf). A full path is required.
.TP 
\fBCONTSCAN file/directory\fR
Scan file or directory (recursively) with archive support enabled and don't stop the scanning when a virus is found.
.TP 
\fBMULTISCAN file/directory\fR
Scan file in a standard way or scan directory (recursively) using multiple threads (to make the scanning faster on SMP machines).
.TP 
\fBSTREAM\fR
Scan stream \- on this command clamd will return "PORT number" you should connect to and send data to scan.
.TP 
\fBSESSION, END\fR
Start/end a clamd session which will allow you to run multiple commands per TCP session. It's recommended to prefix clamd commands with the letter \fBn\fR (eg. nSCAN) to indicate that the command will be delimited by a newline character and that clamd should continue reading command data until a newline is read. The newline delimiter assures that the complete command and its entire argument will be processed as a single command.
