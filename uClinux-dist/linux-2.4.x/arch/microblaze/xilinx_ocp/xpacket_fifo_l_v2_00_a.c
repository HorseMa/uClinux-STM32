/*

* Write data into a 64 bit packet FIFO. The packet FIFO is 64 bits wide in this
* function call such that an input buffer which is a series of bytes must be
* written into the FIFO a word at a time. If the buffer is not a multiple of
* 64 bit words, it is necessary for this function to format the remaining bytes
* into two 32 bit words to be inserted into the FIFO. This is necessary to
* avoid any accesses past the end of the buffer.
*
* @param RegBaseAddress is the base address of the FIFO registers.
* @param DataBaseAddress is the base address of the FIFO keyhole.
* @param BufferPtr points to the memory buffer that data is to be read from
*        and written into the FIFO. Since this buffer is a byte buffer, the
*        data is assumed to be endian independent. This buffer must be 32 bit
*        aligned or an alignment exception could be generated.
* @param ByteCount contains the number of bytes to read from the buffer and to
*        write to the FIFO.
*
* @return
*
* XST_SUCCESS is returned if the operation succeeded.  If there is not enough
* room in the FIFO to hold the specified bytes, XST_PFIFO_NO_ROOM is
* returned.
*
* @note
*
* This function assumes that if the device inserting data into the FIFO is
* a byte device, the order of the bytes in each 64 bit word is from the most
* significant byte to the least significant byte.
