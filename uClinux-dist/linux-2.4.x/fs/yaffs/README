Welcome to YAFFS, the first file system developed specifically for NAND flash.

Before you go too far, you might consider looking at YAFFS2.

A note on licencing
-------------------
YAFFS is available under GPL and via alternative licensing arrangements with
Alpeh One. Generally, if you're using YAFFS as a Linux kernel file system
you can use the GPL and in other cases you need to discuss licensing issues
with Aleph One.


Where do you want to go today?
------------------------------
direct       This is the userspace/RTOS variant of YAFFS. This is used for yaffs
	     core development and for embedding YAFFS in products that don't use
	     Linux or WinCE
linux-module This allows you to build YAFFS as a free-standing Linux kernel
	     module. By "free standing", I mean that this build happens
	     outside the kernel tree. Generally you'd use this for testing.
linux-kernel This allows you to hook YAFFS into the kernel tree, to build
	     YAFFS within the kernel tree.
utils        These are some utilities for Linux.
wince	     Windows CE support. Horribly dated. Contact Aleph One is you're
	     considering YAFFS for a WinCE project.
mtdemul      An mtd NAND emulation driver for testing YAFFS under Linux.
