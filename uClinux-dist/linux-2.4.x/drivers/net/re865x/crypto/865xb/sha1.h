* Revision 1.1.2.1  2007/09/28 14:42:25  davidm
* #12420
*
* Pull in all the appropriate networking files for the RTL8650,  try to
* clean it up a best as possible so that the files for the build are not
* all over the tree.  Still lots of crazy dependencies in there though.
*
* Revision 1.2  2004/06/23 10:15:45  yjlou
* *: convert DOS format to UNIX format
*
* Revision 1.1  2004/06/23 09:18:57  yjlou
* +: support 865xB CRYPTO Engine
*   +: CONFIG_RTL865XB_EXP_CRYPTOENGINE
*   +: basic encry/decry functions (DES/3DES/SHA1/MAC)
*   +: old-fashion API (should be removed in next version)
*   +: batch functions (should be removed in next version)
*
* Revision 1.2  2003/09/01 03:51:07  jzchen
* Change sha1_result parameter definition and constant definition
*
* Revision 1.1  2002/11/11 11:10:33  hiwu
* initial version
