config ARM_AM79C961A
	bool "ARM EBSA110 AM79C961A support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_EBSA110
	select CRC32
	help
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for the EBSA-110, then you should
	  always answer Y to this.

config ARM_ETHER1
	tristate "Acorn Ether1 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these (AKA25) network cards,
	  you should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHER3
	tristate "Acorn/ANT Ether3 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHERH
	tristate "I-cubed EtherH/ANT EtherM support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	select CRC32
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_AT91_ETHER
	tristate "AT91RM9200 Ethernet support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_AT91RM9200
	select MII
	help
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for the AT91RM9200 and enable
	  ethernet support, then you should always answer Y to this.

config EP93XX_ETH
	tristate "EP93xx Ethernet support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_EP93XX
	select MII
	help
	  This is a driver for the ethernet hardware included in EP93xx CPUs.
	  Say Y if you are building a kernel for EP93xx based devices.

config ARM_ETHER00
	tristate "Altera Ether00 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_CAMELOT
	help
	  This is the driver for Altera's ether00 ethernet mac IP core. Say
	  Y here if you want to build support for this into the kernel. It
	  is also available as a module (say M here) that can be inserted/
	  removed from the kernel at the same time as the PLD is configured.
	  If this driver is running on an epxa10 development board then it
	  will generate a suitable hw address based on the board serial
	  number (MTD support is required for this). Otherwise you will
	  need to set a suitable hw address using ifconfig.

config ETH_S3C4510B
	bool "Samsung S3C4510B Ethernet Support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && CPU_S3C4510B
	help
	  This is the driver for Samsung's S3C4510B SoC MAC IP core. Say
	  Y here if you want to build support for this into the kernel.

config P2001_ETH
	tristate "P2001 ethernet driver"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && MII && ARCH_P2001
	default y
