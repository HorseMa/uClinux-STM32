/*
 * $Log: ipsec_life.c,v $
 * Revision 1.13.10.2  2007-09-05 02:39:38  paul
 * include ip.h to account for header file surgery in 2.6.22 [david]
 *
 * Revision 1.13.10.1  2006/10/06 21:39:26  paul
 * Fix for 2.6.18+ only include linux/config.h if AUTOCONF_INCLUDED is not
 * set. This is defined through autoconf.h which is included through the
 * linux kernel build macros.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2004/07/10 19:11:18  mcr
 * 	CONFIG_IPSEC -> CONFIG_KLIPS.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2004/04/23 20:44:35  ken
 * Update comments
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2004/04/06 02:49:26  mcr
 * 	pullup of algo code from alg-branch.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2004/03/30 11:03:10  paul
 * two more occurances of snprintf, found by Sam from a users oops msg.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/10/31 02:27:55  mcr
 * 	pulled up port-selector patches and sa_id elimination.
 *
 * Revision 1.8.4.1  2003/10/29 01:30:41  mcr
 * 	elimited "struct sa_id".
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/02/06 02:00:10  rgb
 * Fixed incorrect debugging text label
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2002/05/23 07:16:26  rgb
 * Fixed absolute/relative reference to lifetime count printout.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2002/04/24 07:55:32  mcr
 * 	#include patches and Makefiles for post-reorg compilation.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2002/04/24 07:36:28  mcr
 * Moved from ./klips/net/ipsec/ipsec_life.c,v
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/01/29 17:17:55  mcr
 * 	moved include of ipsec_param.h to after include of linux/kernel.h
 * 	otherwise, it seems that some option that is set in ipsec_param.h
 * 	screws up something subtle in the include path to kernel.h, and
 * 	it complains on the snprintf() prototype.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/01/29 02:13:17  mcr
 * 	introduction of ipsec_kversion.h means that include of
 * 	ipsec_param.h must preceed any decisions about what files to
 * 	include to deal with differences in kernel source.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/11/26 09:16:14  rgb
 * Merge MCR's ipsec_sa, eroute, proc and struct lifetime changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2001/09/25 02:25:57  mcr
 * 	lifetime structure created and common functions created.
 *
 * Local variables:
 * c-file-style: "linux"
