# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
#
#
# !!!NOTE!!! THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE! DO NOT RELY ON IT!
#
# Consider this the first draft of what I think the proper way to
# configure interfaces is. It makes use of programs like ifconfig(8)
# and dhcpcd(8), and can be called from /etc/init.d/networking,
# /etc/pcmcia/network or the command line. It can configure and
# deconfigure interfaces. In controlled environments it even works.
# It's *very* subject to change, however. Some of the compulsory
# options will become optional. Some of the optional ones might
# become compulsory. Syntax might change. Features might disappear.
# Bugs might disappear. The examples below are reasonably likely
# to remain more or less correct. Maybe.
#                                         -- ajt@debian.org
#
#
# A "#" character in the very first column makes the rest of the line
# be ignored. Blank lines are ignored. Lines may be indented freely.
# A "\" character at the very end of the line indicates the next line
# should be treated as a continuation of the current one.
#
# The "noauto", "up", and "down" options are valid for all interfaces.
# "up" and "down" may be specified multiple times, all other options
# may only be specified once.

# We always want the loopback interface. Whether we want ifup/ifdown to
# know about is another matter, perhaps.
