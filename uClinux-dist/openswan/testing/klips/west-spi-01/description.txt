This tests production of ESP-3DES packets with a source of ICMP packets.

Note that no authentication is done in this variation. Also, the same
SPI# is used for incoming and outgoing. This is bizarre, but some 3COM
gateways do this for "manual keying", and they have some other bizarre
(and trivially DOS'able!) methods of moving manually keyed SAs from one
source to another.
