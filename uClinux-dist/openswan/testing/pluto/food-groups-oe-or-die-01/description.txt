This tests VPN-style Opportunistic Encryption.

East is configured to do OE to the westnet.
West is configured to do only passive OE.
Sunset is alive on the westnet. It has two IPs: .1 (not OE) and .3 (OE).

First east pings westnet .1, and we confirm that, due to the lack of OE,
that communication does not occur.

Then east pings westnet .3, and we confirm communication does occur, encrypted.
