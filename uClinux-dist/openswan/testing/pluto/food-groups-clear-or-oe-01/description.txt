This test sets up east to send a packet to sunset-oe (behind west). 

It does so in the clear.  East is configured to do so in the clear, but
is willing to negotiate OE if the peer's gateway tries.

West, when dealing with the return packet is configured to do so in the
clear.

Contrast this with clear-or-oe-02, where the same scenario occurs, but
west is configured to initiate OE for this address, so it will initiate
the connection and east will accept.
