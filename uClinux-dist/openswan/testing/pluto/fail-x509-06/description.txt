This test except that with a CRL policy set to strict, and no available
CRL, the connection fails. In this case the CRL is not available.
See fail-x509-11/12/13 for testcases with CRL expired, not yet valid and
both valid and invalid's loaded.

East does not have north's certificate cached. 
East will send a CR to north.

East also doesn't have a specific policy for north, but rather, 
will accept anything that is signed by a specific CA.

North will transmit its certificate to east via nic. 
North's certificate  is issued by a CA east accepts (cacerts/ca.crt), and
so should be accepted.
