This is a test of NAT-traversal.

The network is configured as follows:

    POLE
      |
    NORTH
      |
      NIC---EAST--SUNRISE

A NAT is setup on NIC that does traditional NAPT on the
NORTH network. 

The simple test is to connect the POLE and SUNRISE networks
together. 

The NAT is changed such that it will not permit port 500 or 4500
to be used on origination, it blocks ESP, and it times out the connection.
