This test is identical to x509-pluto-02, and fail-x509-02.

However, the certificate that north has been provided has expired. North
is forced to load it by using the arbitrary cert payload feature.

East should refuse to believe the expired certificate.

TODO: This old test is *identical* to fail-x509-02. Why does it exist?
