This test setup is identical to x509-pluto-02, but uses aggressive mode.

The network is configured as follows:

    POLE
      |
    NORTH
      |
      NIC---EAST--SUNRISE

East does not have north's certificate cached. East will send a CR to north, 
and north will transmit its certificate to east via nic. North's certificate
is issued by a CA east accepts (cacerts/caCert.pem), and so should be
accepted.

East has to set "leftca=" so that it will know which CA to ask for.

NIC serves as a simple router between NORTH and EAST.

The simple test is to connect the POLE and SUNRISE networks
together. This is tested with a ping, a la "basic-pluto-03"
