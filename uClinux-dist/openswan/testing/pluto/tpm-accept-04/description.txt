Tcl Test Script #4 - "Check response to corrupted IKE messages":

Part A of test
     - configure the standard configuration
     - start IKE process and listen 
     - wait for successful IKE Phase I and IKE Phase II negotiation 

     - return array of keying material used to decrypt IKE Phase I and IKE
        Phase II messages
     - return decrypted IKE Phase I messages
     - return decrypted IKE Phase II messages

Part B of test

     - configure the IKE tool to corrupt the first three
       encrypted IKE Phase I message before sending it to the DUT so that it
       cannot be decrypted by the DUT 

     - initiate IKE Phase I negotiations with DUT 
     - wait for response from DUT to the first encrypted (but corrupted)
        IKE Phase I message 

     - check to see if DUT retries sending the IKE Phase I response
       message 

     - after three messages, a correct messages goes out, and the phase I
       (and phase II) succeeds.

     - verify successful IKE Phase I negotiation and IKE Phase II
       negotiation 

Part C of test 

     - configure the IKE tool to corrupt first three
       encrypted IKE Phase II message before sending it to the DUT so that it
       cannot be decrypted by the DUT 

     - initiate IKE Phase II negotiations with DUT 
     - wait for response from DUT to the first encrypted (but corrupted)
       IKE Phase II message 

     - check to see if DUT retries sending the IKE Phase II response
       message 

     - after three messages, a correct messages goes out, and the phase I
       (and phase II) succeeds.

     - verify successful IKE Phase I negotiation and IKE Phase II
       negotiation
