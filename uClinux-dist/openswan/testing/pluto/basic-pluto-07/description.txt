Basic pluto test:

"westnet-eastnet": 192.0.1.0/24===192.1.2.45[@west]...192.1.2.23[@east]===192.0.2.0/24

the policy has been adjusted to permit only AES256 for phase 1 and twofish128 
for phase 2.

note: cryptoapi is not built in by default so this test will currently pass, 
as we test for the error messages of the algs being unavailable.
