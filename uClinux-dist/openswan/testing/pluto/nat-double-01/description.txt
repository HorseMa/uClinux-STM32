This is a test of NAT-traversal with TWO nodes behind the NAT.

The network is configured as follows:

    NORTH  ROAD
      |     |
      +-----+
      |
      NIC---EAST--SUNRISE

A NAT is setup on NIC that does traditional NAPT on the
NORTH network. 

This test does two tunnel mode connections, that are each /32,
using an IP address on the inside from the SUNRISE network.
