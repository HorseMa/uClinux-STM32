Tcl Test Script #5 - "Check response to expired IKE negotiation":

- configure the standard configuration 
- start IKE process and listen 
- initiate IKE Phase I negotiations with DUT 
- configure IKE tool to continue negotiating IKE Phase II after the
      IKE Phase I SA has expired 

- wait until IKE Phase I has expired 
- initiate to DUT
- IKE tool should negotiate IKE Phase II with DUT 
- DUT should not accept packets and DUT should start IKE Phase I
      negotiations with IKE tool 

      NOTE: not all DUT's will be able to refresh the IKE phase I.
	    Openswan does not do this, as it could be a Denial of Service.

      NOTE that DUT will attempt to delete the phase I, so Openswan
	   must ignore this message.
