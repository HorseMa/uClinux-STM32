Basic pluto X.509 test, with send_cr.

East does *NOT* have West's X.509 Cert locally.
west is FORCED to send it. And visa versa.

Configuration has been tuned to work around the refine_connection
bug, or another bug with CA's. These bugs require us to specify
the leftid and rightid (otherwise RSA key for IPv4 address is not found).

We also need to set leftsendcert=/rightsendcert.

We also need to set rightca="%any" and leftca="%any" or else the CA is
not found
