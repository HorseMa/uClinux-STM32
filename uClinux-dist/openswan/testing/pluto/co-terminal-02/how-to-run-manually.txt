This assumes that you have scripts to start each UML by name in 
new window.

If you are not online, or multicast is screwed for you, please
read below about "NETJIG":

Start up nic, east, west, japan:
      nic single
      east single
      west single
      japan single

Login to each, password "root"

then, in each:
      cd /testing/pluto/co-terminal-02

In nic, type:
     source nic-init.sh

In east, type:
     source east-init.sh

In west, type:
     source wavesec-init.sh

Now, confirm that things work, in east, do:
     ping -c 2 -n 192.1.2.254
and  ping -c 2 -n 192.1.2.23

In japan, type:
     source japan-init.sh

now, things are setup.

to set things up, do
	source japan-run.sh

	ipsec eroute
(should see a wavesec route)

Now, to provoke things, type:
	ping -c 1 192.1.2.23


NETJIG:
Create a new window, and run uml_netjig:
  testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig --cmdprompt

  netjig> newswitch public
  netjig> newswitch east
  netjig> newswitch west

cut & paste the UML_*_CTL lines to your original window.
Then, export them all.
