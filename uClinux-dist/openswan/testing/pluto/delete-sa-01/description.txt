This test will succeed if notify_delete-2.00.diff is applied to pluto. This
patch worked without failed HUNKs as of 2003 February 6th.

From the Design list:

Expect the test to fail when formally running it; I haven't figured out how to
suppress the variable elements from the ping test I employ (the summary line,
which will almost always vary).

The test uses whack commands to set up a roadwarrior config on east and a
VPN config with an absurdly low keylife (20 seconds) and no rekeying on west.
Once the IPSec SA expires, west shuts down IPSec.    

Using Mathieu's Notify-Delete SA patch - thanks to Ken for porting it to 2.00
- this prompts a Delete SA request for the ISAKMP SA, killing the conn
instance, unrouting the conn, and allowing a clear traffic ping to succeed.

Without Delete SA code, the ping fails, as the peer still has a %trap eroute
in place.

Why the requirement for the low IPSec SA lifetime? It appears that on "ipsec
auto --delete connname", a Delete SA request for the ISAKMP SA gets issued...
but never for the IPSec SA. As a result, the Delete SA is received, but the  
Roadwarrior conn stays up.
