Copy of basic-pluto-01 - similar to phase1-expire-01-reconnect-klips

The initiator, establishing the connection, deletes its phase1,
then a little later, deletes its phase2, and then tries to connect.
The responder is using NETKEY.

This is the behaviour of Windows XP which hangs up after a 1 minute
no-traffic timeout. The problem manifests itself on NETKEY with lingering
routes. This is the KLIPS version of the test.

We try to emulate this behaviour by setting ikelifetime= and lifetime=
options on the initiator, and performing a --down and an --up

This might be related to bug #888
