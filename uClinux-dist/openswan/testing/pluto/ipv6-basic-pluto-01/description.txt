Basic pluto test using IPv6 (and NETKEY):

"westnet-eastnet": XXXXXXXXX/XX===XXXXXXXXXX[@west]...XXXXXXXXXX[@east]===XXXXXXXXX/24

1) west XXXXXXX ping6's east-in/east-eth0/east XXXXXXX on eastnet XXXXXX/XX
2) west adds an iptable rule to block plaintext from eastnet
3) west pings XXXXXXXXX again, but pong should be dropped by rule
4) west initiates connection "westnet-eastnet"; east XXXXXXX responds
5) netjig sends ping packets from westnet to eastnet
