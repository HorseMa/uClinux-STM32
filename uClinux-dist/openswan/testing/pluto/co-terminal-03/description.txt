This test demonstrates the problem that a machine has trying to 
be the initiator of two tunnels to two different systems. The combination
is that of having an extrusion of some kind (i.e. wavesec) as well as having
attempting to do Opportunistic Encryption.

The situation looks like:

      japan		west			east
      OE-rw		wavesec-gw		OE-peer
#1      <***wavesec******>------------------------|
#2      <*****************************************>

There is no problem on wavesec-gw, which has no problem terminating the single
extrusion to japan.

This test differs from co-terminal-02 only in that the two policies are
loaded in the opposite order.
