This test sets up east to send a packet to sunset-oe (behind west).

It does so in the clear. East is configured to do so in the clear.

West, when dealing with the return packet thinks that it is
allowed to do OE, so it attempts.

East however, is NOT set up to do OE, so it refuses the connection,
and the *return* packet comes back in the clear.

Contrast this with clear-or-oe-02, where the same scenario occurs, but  
east *is* configured to accept OE for this address, so it will accept the
connection.
