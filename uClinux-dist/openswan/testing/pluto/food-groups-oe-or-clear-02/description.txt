This test sets up east to send a packet to sunset (behind west).

East doesn't think it should do OE.
West, however, does want to try OE. 

In this test, west will init, which it turns out is okay with east.
(Contrast to food-groups-clear-02)

First east pings westnet's .1, and we confirm communication in the clear.

Then east pings westnet's .3, and we confirm communication that is not in the clear
after the first return packet.
