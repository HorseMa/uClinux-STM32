This is a test of NAT-traversal.

The network is configured as follows:

    POLE
      |
    NORTH
      |
      NIC---EAST--SUNRISE

A NAT is setup on NIC that does traditional NAPT on the
NORTH network. 

The simple test is to connect the POLE and SUNRISE networks
together. 

The connection on north is brought --down and then --up to test that
the rekeying works correctly.
