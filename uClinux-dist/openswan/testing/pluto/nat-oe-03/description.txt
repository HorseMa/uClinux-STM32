This is a test of NAT-traversal.

The network is configured as follows:

        ROAD
         |
        NIC---EAST--SUNRISE
        /
     WEST
      /
SUNSET

A NAT is setup on NIC that does traditional NAPT on the
NORTH network. 

This more complicate test has ROAD extrude a single IP address
from EAST's network. 

WEST is running IPsec, doing OE for sunset, but it is NOT running
with nat-traversal on. The idea is that ROAD can use the IP
address that it has extruded from east's network as a basis for
standard OE.

In theory, this is not co-terminal of the near kind, because
the tunnel from ROAD<->EAST is built upon road's (private)
IP via NAT-T, while, the ROAD<->WEST tunnel is built upon
road's extruded IP.

To make this work, pluto may need to be bashed.
