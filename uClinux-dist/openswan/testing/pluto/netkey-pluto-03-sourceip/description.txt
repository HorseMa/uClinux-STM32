Standard east-west, but with leftsubnet=10.199.199.0/24. Now west uses
leftsourceip=10.199.199.254, which should cause a route to appear:



We are using 10.199.199.0/24 to avoid conflicts with the standard subnets
and their routing via other ethX devices (east-west share multiple subnets
on different interfaces)
