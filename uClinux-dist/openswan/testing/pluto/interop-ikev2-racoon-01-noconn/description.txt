Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west).

This test does not actually do IKEv2, it just *tries*.

The responder (east) does not have ANY conn loaded, and aborts. The
initiator may not crash. This is bug #890.

It seems that openswan does not send any R1 reply to the
I1 packet as responder with no connection, and thus R1 does not
crash on an unexpected NOTIFY packet. To reproduce this, we need to
have to start strongswan as the responder, which does send out an
R1 packet when it has no conns loaded. It is not known yet what racoon
does.

This test depends on the installation of racoon in /usr/local/racoon2
