This test brings up a standard OE gateway, (east) as well as a "road warrior"
living on a different network. 

The road warrior has an FQDN ID only, of roadkey.uml.freeswan.org.
That zone has a KEY record but no TXT record.  There should be a tunnel
and a warning about using the obsolete convention.
