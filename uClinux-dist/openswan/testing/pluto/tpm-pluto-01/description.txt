This is a test case to verify basic TCL Pluto Mix (TAPROOM) functionality.

A script, east.tpm.tcl is provided. It gets copied to $IPSECDIR/tpm.tcl.

Skeleton versions of TCL proceedures for the:
	 processRawPacket
	 recvMessage
	 changeState
	 adjustFailure
	 avoidEmitting

are provided.

The adjustFailure routine examines the state structure to determine if the
keying material has been derived yet, and if so, it logs it using
openswan_DBG_dump(). 

Note that in test cases, the logs are directed to stderr, so "puts stderr"
is essentially equivalent to writing to the logs.
