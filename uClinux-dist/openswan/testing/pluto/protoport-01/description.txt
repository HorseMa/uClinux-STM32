This is a test case for the prototype=17/%any case

For L2TP, OSX clients do not use udp/1701 to send L2TP packets. Instead
they use some random high port. So the policy must allow this. 

The problem is that the server tries to instantiate the conn because of
the %any.

(A different way of writing it was prototype=17/0 but this is confusing,
 and wlaks a different code path)

Perhaps "%highports" could be a keyword, allowing ports > 1024 ?
