This is a test case for the "subnets=" declaration, but with enough
of them to trigger potential timing issues. This testcase also uses
the alternative syntax of "sub/net, sub/net" instead of {subnet subnet}

Pluto doesn't really understand multiple subnets, and IKE can't really
negotiate it.  However, the following does occur.

1) subnets= generates a set of policies. So, this is a processing time
   "macro", if you wish.

2) each policy is given an "alias", and if one --up's an alias, then all
   connections with that alias are brought up (or down).
