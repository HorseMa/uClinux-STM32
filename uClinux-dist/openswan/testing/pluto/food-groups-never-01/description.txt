This tests the foodgroup "never" - it attempts to send a ping from a host
(east) to a clear node (sunrise), verifying that in fact, no packets ever
actually traverse.

The proof of the lack of packets is shown by the fact that that a ping
between the two gateways before and afterwards does in fact succeed.
