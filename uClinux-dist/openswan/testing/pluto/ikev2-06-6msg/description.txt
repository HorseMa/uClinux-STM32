Same as ikev2-03-basic-rawrsa, but now pluto is forced to be "busy" using
the force_busy=yes option, simulating a Denial of Service attack. 

Pluto should then use cookies and forget initial state of packets unless
they have a valid cookie. This is also known as the "6 message Exchange".

This is similar to <insert testcase here for ikev1 aggressive mode> :)
