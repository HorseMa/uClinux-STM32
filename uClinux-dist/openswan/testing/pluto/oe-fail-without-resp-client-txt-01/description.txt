This tests that OE won't succeed if Responder's client doesn't have
the required TXT record.

It is a variant of oe-fail-without-private-key-01.

East simulates OE to the westnet.  (It cannot actually do OE due to
the lack of TXT record, the point of this exercise.)

West is configured to do only passive OE.
sunset is alive on the westnet. It has two IPs: .1 (not OE) and .3 (OE).

east tries to initiate opportunistically with westnet .1.  This should
fail in Phase 2, when west discovers the client proposed for west's side.
