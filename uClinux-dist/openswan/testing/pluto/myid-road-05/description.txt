This test brings up a standard OE gateway, (east) as well as a "road warrior"
living on a different network. 

The road warrior has to guess it's ID, and it will conclude on a forward
iOE TXT value. The difference between this and myid-road-01 and this,
is that there is a trailing . in the hostname.
