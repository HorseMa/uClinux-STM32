These tests are Pluto uml tests - it loads a bunch of valid
connections to check output. This is to catch a bug in the
AES code, where using ike=aes-sha1-modp1536 leads to:

| ike (phase1) algorihtm values: AES_CBC(7)_000-SHA1(2)-MODP1536(5); flags=-strict

instead of:

| ike (phase1) algorihtm values: AES_CBC(7)_128-SHA1(2)-MODP1536(5); flags=-strict


These tests are focused on loading various conns with ike= lines.

It does not talk to KLIPS at all, nor does it even attempt to
establish a connection, only putting connections into pluto.
