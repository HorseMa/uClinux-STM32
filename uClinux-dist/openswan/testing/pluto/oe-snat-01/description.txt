This test invokes Opportunistic Encryption for a gateway that performs source
NAPT (aka "IP masquerading") on the packets first.

NOTE, that this test manages *sunset* and *west*, but uses the mechanism
for managing "east" to manage "sunset". As a result, the output files are
named "east", which may well be confusing.
