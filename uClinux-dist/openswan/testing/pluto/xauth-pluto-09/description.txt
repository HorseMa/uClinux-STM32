This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses PSK to authenticate for phase 1.
It uses aggressive mode.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.
It then uses MODECFG to configure the phase 2, in server push mode.

It then proceeds to phase 2.

This differs from xauth-pluto-05 in that left/right in the conn 
are reversed. This is a test for reported bug 246:
