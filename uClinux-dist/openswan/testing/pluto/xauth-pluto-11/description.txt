This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses RSASIG to authenticate for phase 1.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.
It uses leftxauthname= to obtain the XAUTH username,
and gets the password from ipsec.secrets.

It then proceeds to phase 2.

(see -04 for a case where aggressive mode is used)
