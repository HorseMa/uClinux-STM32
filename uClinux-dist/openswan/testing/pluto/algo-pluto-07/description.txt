Unsupported alg pluto test:

"westnet-eastnet": 192.0.1.0/24===192.1.2.45[@west]...192.1.2.23[@east]===192.0.2.0/24

The policy has been adjusted to request SHA2 for phase 2, which is supported
by NETKEY, but not by KLIPS.

When using NETKEY, this apparently crashes pluto. This is bug #496

Note: This testcase will only properly work once the testing harness can
properly set the protostack=netkey
