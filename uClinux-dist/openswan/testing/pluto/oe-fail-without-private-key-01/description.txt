This tests that OE won't be attempted if Initiator doesn't have the
required private RSA key.

It is a variant of food-groups-oe-or-die-01.

East is configured to do OE to the westnet.
West is configured to do only passive OE.
sunset is alive on the westnet. It has two IPs: .1 (not OE) and .3 (OE).

east tries to initiate opportunistically with westnet .3.  This should
fail early, when east notices that its private key doesn't match any
public key in KEY records for itself.  Failure should come before
negotiation is actually started.
