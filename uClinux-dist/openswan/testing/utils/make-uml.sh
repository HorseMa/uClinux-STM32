# 	make-uml script was building statically linked FreeSWAN kernels
# 	only by fluke - turns out that "make oldconfig" blows away
# 	any options in .config that weren't defined. Thus, the initial
# 	build of a non-SWAN kernel before building FreeSWAN would
# 	blow away the CONFIG_IPSEC options- specifically the CONFIG_IPSEC=y
# 	(vs =m). This worked before because "make insert" put the
# 	options back in, but now that the default has changed to modules,
# 	the it defaults the wrong way.
# 	Solution: copy the .config file in again after the plain build.
#
# Revision 1.14  2002/04/03 23:42:18  mcr

#
# Revision 1.10  2001/11/27 05:36:30  mcr
# 	just look for a kernel in build directory. This

#
# Revision 1.9  2001/11/23 00:36:01  mcr
