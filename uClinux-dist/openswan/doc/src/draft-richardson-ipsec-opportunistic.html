<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
This document describes opportunistic encryption (OE) as designed
and implemented by the Linux FreeS/WAN project. OE uses the Internet
Key Exchange (IKE) and IPsec protocols.
The objective is to allow encryption for secure communication without
any pre-arrangement specific to the pair of systems involved.
DNS is used to distribute the public keys of each
system involved. This is resistant to passive attacks. The use of DNS
Security (DNSSEC) secures this system against active attackers as well. 
  
</p>
<p>
As a result, the administrative overhead is reduced
from the square of the number of systems to a linear dependence, and
it becomes possible to make secure communication the default even
when the partner is not known in advance.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor2">1.1</a>&nbsp;Motivation</h4>

<p>
The objective of opportunistic encryption is to allow encryption without
any pre-arrangement specific to the pair of systems involved. Each
system administrator adds
public key information to DNS records to support opportunistic
encryption and then enables this feature in the nodes' IPsec stack. 
Once this is done, any two such nodes can communicate securely.

</p>
<p>
This document describes opportunistic encryption as designed and
implemented by the Linux FreeS/WAN project in revisions up and including 2.00.
Note that 2.01 and beyond implements <a href="#RFC3445" title="Massey, D. and S. Rose, Limiting the Scope of the KEY Resource Record (RR), December 2002."quot;">[RFC3445]</a> in a backward compatible way.
A future document <a href="#IPSECKEY" title="Richardson, M., A Method for Storing IPsec Keying Material in DNS, July 2004."quot;">[IPSECKEY]</a>
will describe a variation that complies with RFC3445.
For project information, see http://www.freeswan.org. 

</p>
<p>
The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and Internet Engineering
Steering Group (IESG) have taken a strong stand that the Internet
should use powerful encryption to provide security and
privacy <a href="#RFC1984" title="IAB, IESG, Carpenter, B. and F. Baker, IAB and IESG Statement on Cryptographic Technology and the Internet, August 1996."quot;">[RFC1984]</a>.
The Linux FreeS/WAN project attempts to provide a practical means to implement this policy. 
  
</p>
<p>
The project uses the IPsec, ISAKMP/IKE, DNS and DNSSEC
protocols because they are
standardized, widely available and can often be deployed very easily
without changing hardware or software or retraining users. 
  
</p>
<p>
The extensions to support opportunistic encryption are simple.  No
changes to any on-the-wire formats are needed.  The only changes are to 
the policy decision making system.  This means that opportunistic
encryption can be implemented with very minimal changes to an existing 
IPsec implementation.
  
</p>
<p>
Opportunistic encryption creates a "fax effect". The proliferation
of the fax machine was possible because it did not require that everyone
buy one overnight. Instead, as each person installed one, the value
of having one increased - as there were more people that could receive faxes.
Once opportunistic encryption is installed it
automatically recognizes 
other boxes using opportunistic encryption, without any further configuration
by the network 
administrator. So, as opportunistic encryption software is installed on more
boxes, its value 
as a tool increases.

</p>
<p>
This document describes the infrastructure to permit deployment of
Opportunistic Encryption.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor3">1.2</a>&nbsp;Encryption Regimes</h4>

<p>
    To aid in understanding the relationship between security processing
    and IPsec we divide policies controlling network traffic into four
    categories. The traffic is categorized by destination
    address using longest prefix match. Each category is therefore 
    enumerated by a set of network prefixes. The categories are mutually
    exclusive - a particular prefix should only occur in one category.

    </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>* Deny:</dt>
<dd> network prefixes to which traffic is always forbidden.
</dd>
<dt>* Permit:</dt>
<dd> network prefixes to which traffic in the clear is permitted.
</dd>
<dt>* Opportunistic tunnel:</dt>
<dd> network prefixes to which traffic is encrypted if possible, when it otherwise might be sent in the clear. 
      
</dd>
<dt>* Configured tunnel:</dt>
<dd> networks prefixes which traffic
must be encrypted, and traffic in the clear is never permitted.
A traditionally defined Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a form of
configured tunnel. 

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
Traditional firewall devices handle the first two categories.
No authentication is required.  
The permit policy is currently the default on the Internet. 

</p>
<p>
This document describes the third category - opportunistic tunnel, which is
proposed as the new default for the Internet.

</p>
<p>
  Category four's policy is a very strict, "encrypt it or drop it" policy,
requires authentication of the end points. As the number of end points is
typically bounded and is typically 
  under a single authority, arranging for distribution of
  authentication material, while difficult, does not require any new
  technology. The mechanism described here, however, does provides an
additional way to distribute the authentication materials, that of a
public key method that does not require deployment of an X.509 based
infrastructure.   

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor4">1.3</a>&nbsp;Peer authentication in opportunistic encryption</h4>

<p>
  Opportunistic encryption creates tunnels between nodes that
  are essentially strangers. This is done without any prior bilateral
  arrangement. 
  There is, therefore, the difficult question of how one knows to whom one is
  talking.
  
</p>
<p>
  One possible answer is that since no useful
  authentication can be done, none should be tried. This mode of operation is
  named "anonymous encryption".  An active man-in-the-middle attack can be
  used to thwart the privacy of this type of communication. 
  Without peer authentication, there is no way to prevent this kind of attack.
  
</p>
<p>
Although a useful mode, anonymous encryption is not the goal of this
project. Simpler methods are available that can achieve anonymous
encryption only, but authentication of the peer is a desireable goal.
Authentication of the peer is achieved through key distribution in
DNS, leveraging upon the authentication of the DNS in DNSSEC.

</p>
<p>
  Peers are, therefore, authenticated with DNSSEC when available. Local policy 
determines how much trust to extend when DNSSEC is not available.
  
</p>
<p>
  An essential premise of building private connections with
  strangers is that datagrams received through opportunistic tunnels
  are no more special than datagrams that arrive in the clear.
  Unlike in a VPN, these datagrams should not be given any special
  exceptions when it comes to auditing, further authentication or
  firewalling.
  
</p>
<p>
  When initiating outbound opportunistic encryption, local 
  configuration determines what happens if tunnel setup fails. It may be that
  the packet goes out in the clear, or it may be dropped.

gateway node as described in <a href="#RFC0791" title="Postel, J., Internet Protocol, September 1981."quot;">[RFC0791]</a> section 2.4 and  
<a href="#RFC1009" title="Braden, R. and J. Postel, Requirements for Internet gateways, June 1987."quot;">[RFC1009]</a> with the additional capabilities described here and
in <a href="#RFC2401" title="Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, November 1998."quot;">[RFC2401]</a>.  
The algorithm described here provides a way to determine, for each datagram,
whether or not to encrypt and tunnel the datagram. Two important things
that must be determined are whether or not to encrypt and tunnel and, if
so, the destination address or name of the tunnel end point which should be used. 

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor10">2.3.1</a>&nbsp;Tunnel authorization</h4>

<p>
The OE gateway determines whether or not to create a tunnel based on 
the destination address of each packet. Upon receiving a packet with a destination
address not recently seen, the OE gateway performs a lookup in DNS for an
authorization resource record (see <a href="#TXT">Section 5.2</a>). The record is located using
the IP address to perform a search in the in-addr.arpa (IPv4) or ip6.arpa
(IPv6) maps. If an authorization record is found, the OE gateway 
interprets this as a request for a tunnel to be formed.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.3.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor11">2.3.2</a>&nbsp;Tunnel end-point discovery</h4>

<p>
The authorization resource record also provides the address or name of the tunnel
end point which should be used.

</p>
<p>
The record may also provide the public RSA key of the tunnel end point
itself. This is provided for efficiency only. If the public RSA key is not 
present, the OE gateway performs a second lookup to find a KEY 
resource record for the end point address or name.

</p>
<p>
Origin and integrity protection of the resource records is provided by 
DNSSEC (see <a href="#RFC2535" title="Eastlake, D., Domain Name System Security Extensions, March 1999."quot;">[RFC2535]</a>). <a href="#nodnssec">Section 3.2.4.1</a>
documents an optional restriction on the tunnel end point if DNSSEC signatures
are not available for the relevant records. 

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.3.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor12">2.3.3</a>&nbsp;Caching of authorization results</h4>

<p>
The OE gateway maintains a cache, in the forwarding plane, of
source/destination pairs for which opportunistic encryption has been
attempted. This cache maintains a record of whether or not OE was
successful so that subsequent datagrams can be forwarded properly
without additional delay. 

</p>
<p>
Successful negotiation of OE instantiates a new security association. 
Failure to negotiate OE results in creation of a 
forwarding policy entry either to deny or permit transmission in the
clear future datagrams. This negative cache is necessary to avoid the
possibly lengthy process of repeatedly looking  up the same information.

</p>
<p>
The cache is timed out periodically, as described in <a href="#teardown">Section 3.4</a>.
This removes entries that are no longer
being used and permits the discovery of changes in authorization policy.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;Protocol Specification</h3>

<p>
The OE gateway is modeled to have a forwarding plane and a control
plane. A control channel, such as PF_KEY <a href="#RFC2367" title="McDonald, D., Metz, C. and B. Phan, PF_KEY Key Management API, Version 2, July 1998."quot;">[RFC2367]</a>,
connects the two planes.  

</p>
<p>
The forwarding plane performs per datagram operations. The control plane
contains a keying daemon, such as ISAKMP/IKE, and performs all
authorization, peer authentication and key derivation functions.   

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor14">3.1</a>&nbsp;Forwarding plane state machine</h4>

<p>
Let the OE gateway maintain a collection of objects -- a superset of the
security policy database (SPD) specified in <a href="#RFC2401" title="Kent, S. and R. Atkinson, Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, November 1998."quot;">[RFC2401]</a>. For
each combination of source and destination address, an SPD
object exists in one of five following states.
Prior to forwarding each datagram, the responder uses the source and
destination addresses to pick an entry from the SPD. 
The SPD then determines if and how the packet is forwarded.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor15">3.1.1</a>&nbsp;Non-existent policy</h4>

<p>
If the gateway does not find an entry, then this policy applies.
The gateway creates an entry with an initial state of "hold policy" and requests 
keying material from the keying daemon. The gateway does not forward the datagram,
rather it SHOULD attach the datagram to the SPD entry as the  "first" datagram and retain it 
for eventual transmission in a new state. 


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor16">3.1.2</a>&nbsp;Hold policy</h4>

<p>
The gateway requests keying material. If the interface to the keying
system is lossy (PF_KEY, for instance, can be), the implementation 
SHOULD include a mechanism to retransmit the
keying request at a rate limited to less than 1 request per second.
The gateway does not forward the datagram. The gateway SHOULD attach the 
datagram to the SPD entry as the "last" datagram where it is retained 
for eventual transmission.
If there is a datagram already so stored, then that already stored datagram is discarded.

</p>
<p>
The rationale behind saving the the "first" and "last" datagrams are
as follows: 
The "first" datagram is probably a TCP SYN packet. Once there is keying
established, the gateway will release this datagram, avoiding the need 
for the end-point to retransmit the datagram. In the case where the
connection was not a TCP connection, but was instead a streaming
protocol or a DNS request, the "last" datagram that was retained is
likely the most recent data. The difference between "first" and "last"
may also help the end-points determine 
which data was dropped while negotiation took place.  

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor17">3.1.3</a>&nbsp;Pass-through policy</h4>

<p>
The gateway forwards the datagram using the normal forwarding table. 
The gateway enters this state only by command from the keying daemon, 
and upon entering this state, also forwards the "first" and "last" datagrams.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor18">3.1.4</a>&nbsp;Deny policy</h4>

<p>
The gateway discards the datagram. The gateway enters this state only by
command  
from the keying daemon, and upon entering this state, discards the "first"
and "last" datagrams.
An implementation MAY provide the administator with a control to determine
if further datagrams cause ICMP messages
to be generated (i.e. ICMP Destination Unreachable, Communication
Administratively Prohibited. type=3, code=13). 

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor19">3.1.5</a>&nbsp;Encrypt policy</h4>

<p>
The gateway encrypts the datagram using the indicated security association database
(SAD) entry.  The gateway enters this state only by command from the keying daemon, and upon entering
this state, releases and forwards the "first" and "last" datagrams using the
new encrypt policy.  

</p>
<p>
If the associated SAD entry expires because of byte, packet or time limits, then
the entry returns to the Hold policy, and an expire message is sent to the keying daemon.

</p>
<p>
All states may be created directly by the keying daemon while acting as a
gateway. 

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h4><a name="initclasses">3.2</a>&nbsp;Keying Daemon -- initiator</h4>

<p>
Let the keying daemon maintain a collection of objects. Let them be
called "connections" or "conn"s. There are two categories of
connection objects: classes and instances. A class represents an
abstract policy - what could be. An instance represents an actual
connection - what is running at the time.

</p>
<p>
Let there be two further subtypes of connections: keying channels (Phase
1 SAs) and data channels (Phase 2 SAs). Each data channel object may have 
a corresponding SPD and SAD entry maintained by the datagram state machine.

</p>
<p>
For the purposes of opportunistic encryption, there MUST, at least, be
connection classes known as "deny", "always-clear-text", "OE-permissive", and 
"OE-paranoid".  

The latter two connection classes define a set of destination
prefixes for which opportunistic encryption will be attempted. 
The administrator MAY set policy options in a number of additional places.
An implementation MAY create additional connection classes to further refine
these policies.

</p>
<p>
The simplest system may need only the "OE-permissive" connection, and would
list its own (single) IP address as the source address of this policy and
the wild-card address 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination IPv4 address. That is, the
simplest policy is to try opportunistic encryption with all destinations. 

</p>
<p>
This simplest policy SHOULD be offered as a preconfigured default.

</p>
<p>
The distinction between permissive and paranoid Opportunistic
Encryption ("OE-paranoid" below) use will become clear in the state
transition differences. 

</p>
<p>
In brief, an OE-permissive policy means to permit traffic to flow in
the clear, when there is a failure to find and/or use the encryption
keys. OE-permissive permits the network to function, even if in an
insecure manner.

</p>
<p>
A paranoid OE ("OE-paranoid"") will, on failure, install a drop
policy. OE-paranoid permits traffic to flow only when appropriate
security is available.

</p>
<p>
In this description of the keying machine's state transitions, the states
associated with the keying system itself are omitted because they are
best documented in the keying system 
(<a href="#RFC2407" title="Piper, D., The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP, November 1998."quot;">[RFC2407]</a>, 
<a href="#RFC2408" title="Maughan, D., Schneider, M. and M. Schertler, Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), November 1998."quot;">[RFC2408]</a> and <a href="#RFC2409" title="Harkins, D. and D. Carrel, The Internet Key Exchange (IKE), November 1998."quot;">[RFC2409]</a> for ISAKMP/IKE),
and the details are keying system specific. Opportunistic encryption is not
dependent upon any specific keying protocol, but this document does provide
requirements for those using ISAKMP/IKE to assure that implementations
inter-operate.

</p>
<p>
The state transitions that may be involved in communicating with the
forwarding plane are omitted. PF_KEY and similar protocols have their own
set of states required for message sends and completion notifications.

</p>
<p>
Finally, the retransmits and recursive lookups that are normal for DNS are 
not included in this description of the state machine.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor20">3.2.1</a>&nbsp;Nonexistent connection</h4>

<p>
There is no connection instance for a given source/destination address pair.
Upon receipt of a request for keying material for this
source/destination pair, the initiator searches through the connection
classes to determine the most appropriate policy. Upon determining an
appropriate connection class, an instance object is created of that
type.  Both of the OE types result in a potential OE connection.

</p>
<p>Failure to find an appropriate connection class results in an
administrator defined default. 

</p>
<p>
In each case, when the initiator finds an appropriate class for the new flow, 
an instance connection is made of the class which matched.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor21">3.2.2</a>&nbsp;Clear-text connection</h4>

<p>
The non-existent connection makes a transition to this state when an
always-clear-text class is instantiated, or when an OE-permissive 
connection fails. During the transition, the initiator creates a pass-through
policy object in the forwarding plane for the appropriate flow.

</p>
<p>
Timing out is the only way to leave this state
(see <a href="#expiring">Section 3.2.7</a>).

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor22">3.2.3</a>&nbsp;Deny connection</h4>

<p>
The empty connection makes a transition to this state when a
deny class is instantiated, or when an OE-paranoid connection fails. 
During the transition, the initiator creates a deny policy object in
the forwarding plane  for the appropriate flow.  

</p>
<p>
Timing out is the only way to leave this state 
(see <a href="#expiring">Section 3.2.7</a>).

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.4"></a><h4><a name="potentialOE">3.2.4</a>&nbsp;Potential OE connection</h4>

<p>
The empty connection makes a transition to this state when one of
either OE class is instantiated. 
During the transition to this state, the initiator creates a hold
policy object in the forwarding plane for the appropriate flow.  

</p>
<p>
In addition, when making a transition into this state, DNS lookup is done in
the reverse-map for a TXT delegation resource record (see <a href="#TXT">Section 5.2</a>).
The lookup key is the destination address of the flow.

</p>
<p>
There are three ways to exit this state: 
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>DNS lookup finds a TXT delegation resource record.
</li>
<li>DNS lookup does not find a TXT delegation resource record.
</li>
<li>DNS lookup times out.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Based upon the results of the DNS lookup, the potential OE connection makes a
transition to the pending OE connection state.  The conditions for a
successful DNS look are:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>DNS finds an appropriate resource record
</li>
<li>It is properly formatted according to <a href="#TXT">Section 5.2</a>
</li>
<li> if DNSSEC is enabled, then the signature has been vouched for.
</li>
</ol><p>

Note that if the initiator does not find the public key 
present in the TXT delegation record, then the public key must 
be looked up as a sub-state. Only successful completion of all the 
DNS lookups is considered a success.

</p>
<p>
If DNS lookup does not find a resource record or DNS times out, then the 
initiator considers the receiver not OE capable. If this is an
OE-paranoid instance, then the potential OE connection makes a
transition to the deny connection state. If this is an OE-permissive
instance, then the potential OE connection makes a transition to the 
clear-text connection state.

</p>
<p>
If the initiator finds a resource record but it is not properly formatted, or
if DNSSEC is 
enabled and reports a failure to authenticate, then the potential OE
connection makes a 
transition to the deny connection state. This action SHOULD be logged. If the
administrator wishes to override this transition between states, then an
always-clear class can be installed for this flow. An implementation MAY make
this situation a new class.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.4.1"></a><h4><a name="nodnssec">3.2.4.1</a>&nbsp;Restriction on unauthenticated TXT delegation records</h4>

<p>
An implementation SHOULD also provide an additional administrative control
on delegation records and DNSSEC. This control would apply to delegation
records (the TXT records in the reverse-map) that are not protected by
DNSSEC.
Records of this type are only permitted to delegate to their own address as
a gateway. When this option is enabled, an active attack on DNS will be
unable to redirect packets to other than the original destination.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor23">3.2.5</a>&nbsp;Pending OE connection</h4>

<p>
The potential OE connection makes a transition to this state when 
the initiator determines that all the information required from the DNS lookup is present.
Upon entering this state, the initiator attempts to initiate keying to the gateway
provided.  

</p>
<p>
Exit from this state occurs either with a successfully created IPsec SA, or
with a failure of some kind.  Successful SA creation results in a transition
to the key connection state.

</p>
<p>
Three failures have caused significant problems. They are clearly not the
only possible failures from keying.

</p>
<p>
Note that if there are multiple gateways available in the TXT delegation
records, then a failure can only be declared after all have been
tried. Further, creation of a phase 1 SA does not constitute success. A set
of phase 2 SAs (a tunnel) is considered success.

</p>
<p>
The first failure occurs when an ICMP port unreachable is consistently received
without any other communication, or when there is silence from the remote
end. This usually means that either the gateway is not alive, or the
keying daemon is not functional. For an OE-permissive connection, the initiator makes a transition
to the clear-text connection but with a low lifespan. For an OE-pessimistic connection,
the initiator makes a transition to the deny connection again with a low lifespan. The
lifespan in both 
cases is kept low because the remote gateway may
be in the process of rebooting or be otherwise temporarily unavailable. 

</p>
<p>
The length of time to wait for the remote keying daemon to wake up is
a matter of some debate. If there is a routing failure, 5 minutes is usually long
enough for the network to
re-converge. Many systems can reboot in that amount of
time as well. However, 5 minutes is far too long for most users to wait to
hear that they can not connect using OE. Implementations SHOULD make this a
tunable parameter.

</p>
<p>
The second failure occurs after a phase 1 SA has been created, but there is 
either no response to the phase 2 proposal, or the initiator receives a 
negative notify (the notify must be 
authenticated). The remote gateway is not prepared to do OE at this time. 
As before, the initiator makes a transition to the clear-text or the deny 
connection based upon connection class, but this
time with a normal lifespan. 

</p>
<p>
The third failure occurs when there is signature failure while authenticating
the remote gateway. This can occur when there has been a 
key roll-over, but DNS has not caught up. In this case again, the initiator makes a 
transition to the clear-text or the deny connection based
upon the connection class. However, the lifespan depends upon the remaining
time to live in the DNS. (Note that DNSSEC signed resource records have a different
expiry time than non-signed records.) 

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.6"></a><h4><a name="keyed">3.2.6</a>&nbsp;Keyed connection</h4>

<p>
The pending OE connection makes a transition to this state when 
session keying material (the phase 2 SAs) is derived. The initiator creates an encrypt
policy in the forwarding plane for this flow.

</p>
<p>
There are three ways to exit this state. The first is by receipt of an
authenticated delete message (via the keying channel) from the peer. This is
normal teardown and results in a transition to the expired connection state.

</p>
<p>
The second exit is by expiry of the forwarding plane keying material. This
starts a re-key operation with a transition back to pending OE
connection. In general, the soft expiry occurs with sufficient time left
to continue to use the keys. A re-key can fail, which may
result in the connection failing to clear-text or deny as
appropriate. In the event of a failure, the forwarding plane
policy does not change until the phase 2 SA (IPsec SA) reaches its
hard expiry.

</p>
<p>
The third exit is in response to a negotiation from a remote
gateway. If the forwarding plane signals the control plane that it has received an
unknown SPI from the remote gateway, or an ICMP is received from the remote gateway
indicating an unknown SPI, the initiator should consider that 
the remote gateway has rebooted or restarted. Since these 
indications are easily forged, the implementation must 
exercise care.  The initiator should make a cautious 
(rate-limited) attempt to re-key the connection. 

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.7"></a><h4><a name="expiring">3.2.7</a>&nbsp;Expiring connection</h4>

<p>
The initiator will periodically place each of the deny, clear-text, and keyed
connections into this  
sub-state. See <a href="#teardown">Section 3.4</a> for more details of how often this
occurs. 
The initiator queries the forwarding plane for last use time of the
appropriate 
policy. If the last use time is relatively recent, then the connection
returns to the 
previous deny, clear-text or keyed connection state. If not, then the
connection enters 
the expired connection state. 

</p>
<p>
The DNS query and answer that lead to the expiring connection state are also
examined. The DNS query may become stale. (A negative, i.e. no such record, answer
is valid for the period of time given by the MINIMUM field in an attached SOA 
record. See <a href="#RFC1034" title="Mockapetris, P., Domain names - concepts and facilities, November 1987."quot;">[RFC1034]</a> section 4.3.4.)
If the DNS query is stale, then a new query is made. If the results change, then the connection 
makes a transition to a new state as described in potential OE connection state.

</p>
<p> 
Note that when considering how stale a connection is, both outgoing SPD and
incoming SAD must be queried as some flows may be unidirectional for some time.

</p>
<p>
Also note that the policy at the forwarding plane is not updated unless there
is a conclusion that there should be a change.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2.8"></a><h4><a name="anchor24">3.2.8</a>&nbsp;Expired connection</h4>

<p>
Entry to this state occurs when no datagrams have been forwarded recently via the
appropriate SPD and SAD objects. The objects in the forwarding plane are
removed (logging any final byte and packet counts if appropriate) and the
connection instance in the keying plane is deleted. 

</p>
<p>
The initiator sends an ISAKMP/IKE delete to clean up the phase 2 SAs as described in
<a href="#teardown">Section 3.4</a>. 

</p>
<p>
Whether or not to delete the phase 1 SAs
at this time is left as a local implementation issue. Implementations
that do delete the phase 1 SAs MUST send authenticated delete messages to
indicate that they are doing so.  There is an advantage to keeping
the phase 1 SAs until they expire - they may prove useful again in the 
near future.

</pre>

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor26">3.3.1</a>&nbsp;Unauthenticated OE peer</h4>

<p>
Upon entering this state, the responder starts a DNS lookup for a KEY
record for the initiator. 
The responder looks in the reverse-map for a KEY record for the
initiator if the initiator has offered an ID_IPV4_ADDR, and in the
forward map if the initiator has offered an ID_FQDN type. (See <a href="#RFC2407" title="Piper, D., The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP, November 1998."quot;">[RFC2407]</a> section  
4.6.2.1.)

</p>
<p>
The responder exits this state upon successful receipt of a KEY from
DNS, and use of the key to verify the signature of the initiator.

</p>
<p>
Successful authentication of the peer results in a transition to the
authenticated OE Peer state.

</p>
<p>
Note that the unauthenticated OE peer state generally occurs in the
middle of the key negotiation protocol. It is really a form of pseudo-state.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.3.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor27">3.3.2</a>&nbsp;Authenticated OE Peer</h4>

<p>
The peer will eventually propose one or more phase 2 SAs. The
responder uses the source and destination address in the proposal to 
finish instantiating the connection state using the connection class table.
The responder MUST search for an identical connection object at this point. 

</p>
<p> 
If an identical connection is found, then the responder deletes the
old instance, and the new object makes a transition to the pending OE
connection state. This means that new ISAKMP connections with a given
peer will always use the latest instance, which is the correct one if
the peer has rebooted in the interim. 

</p>
<p> 
If an identical connection is not found, then the responder makes the
transition according to the rules given for the initiator - it
installs appropriate policy: clear, drop, or OE. 

</p>
<p>
If OE, and the phase 2 ID (source IP) is different than the phase 1 
ID, then additional authorization is required. 
A TXT record associated with the phase 2 source IP proposed is
requested. This is used to confirm authorization for the phase 1
identity to encrypt on behalf of the phase 2. Successful retrieval
results in a transition to "Authorized OE Peer"

</p>
<p> 
Note that if the initiator is in OE-paranoid mode and the responder is in 
either always-clear-text or deny, then no communication is possible according
to policy. An implementation is permitted to create new types of policies 
such as "accept OE but do not initiate it". This is a local matter.
 
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.3.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor28">3.3.3</a>&nbsp;Authorized OE Peer</h4>

<p>
This state is entered from the Authenticated OE Peer state, upon
successful retrieval of the TXT record. The contents of the record are
confirmed - any failures lead to errors, as in <a href="#potentialOE">Section 3.2.4</a>.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h4><a name="teardown">3.4</a>&nbsp;Renewal and teardown</h4>

<a name="rfc.section.3.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor29">3.4.1</a>&nbsp;Aging</h4>

<p>
A potentially unlimited number of tunnels may exist. In practice, only a few
tunnels are used during a period of time. Unused tunnels MUST, therefore, be
torn down. Detecting when tunnels are no longer in use is the subject of this section.

</p>
<p>
There are two methods for removing tunnels: explicit deletion or expiry. 

</p>
<p>
Explicit deletion requires an IKE delete message. As the deletes
MUST be authenticated, both ends of the tunnel must maintain the 
key channel (phase 1 ISAKMP SA). An implementation which refuses to either maintain or
recreate the keying channel SA will be unable to use this method.

</p>
<p>
The tunnel expiry method simply allows the IKE daemon to
expire normally without attempting to re-key it.

</p>
<p>
Regardless of which method is used to remove tunnels, the implementation MUST
use a method to determine if the tunnel is still in use.  The specifics are a
local matter, but  the FreeS/WAN project uses the following criteria. These
criteria are currently implemented in the key management daemon, but could
also be implemented at the SPD layer using an idle timer.

</p>
<p>
Set a short initial (soft) lifespan of 1 minute since many net flows last
only a few seconds.

</p>
<p>
At the end of the lifespan, check to see if the tunnel was used by
traffic in either direction during the last 30 seconds. If so, assign a
longer tentative lifespan of 20 minutes after which, look again. If the
tunnel is not in use, then close the tunnel.

</p>
<p>
The expiring state in the key management
system (see <a href="#expiring">Section 3.2.7</a>) implements these timeouts.
The timer above may be in the forwarding plane, 
but then it must be re-settable. 

</p>
<p>
The tentative lifespan is independent of re-keying; it is just the time when
the tunnel's future is next considered. 
(The term lifespan is used here rather than lifetime for this reason.) 
Unlike re-keying, this tunnel use check is not costly and should happen
reasonably frequently.

</p>
<p>
A multi-step back-off algorithm is not considered worth the effort here.

</p>
<p>
If the security gateway and the client host are the
same and not a Bump-in-the-Stack or Bump-in-the-Wire implementation, tunnel
teardown decisions MAY pay attention to TCP connection status as reported
by the local TCP layer.  A still-open TCP connection is almost a guarantee that more traffic is
expected. Closing of the only TCP connection through a tunnel is a
strong hint that no more traffic is expected.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.4.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor30">3.4.2</a>&nbsp;Teardown and cleanup</h4>

<p>
Teardown should always be coordinated between the two ends of the tunnel by 
interpreting and sending delete notifications. There is a
detailed sub-state in the expired connection state of the key manager that
relates to retransmits of the delete notifications, but this is considered to 
be a keying system detail.

</p>
<p>
On receiving a delete for the outbound SAs of a tunnel (or some subset of
them), tear down the inbound ones also and notify the remote end with a
delete. If the local system receives a delete for a tunnel which is no longer in
existence, then two delete messages have crossed paths. Ignore the delete.
The operation has already been completed. Do not generate any messages in this
situation. 

</p>
<p>
Tunnels are to be considered as bidirectional entities, even though the
low-level protocols don't treat them this way. 

</p>
<p>
When the deletion is initiated locally, rather than as a
response to a received delete, send a delete for (all) the
inbound SAs of a tunnel.  If the local system does not receive a responding delete 
for the outbound SAs, try re-sending the original
delete. Three tries spaced 10 seconds apart seems a reasonable
level of effort. A failure of the other end to respond after 3 attempts, 
indicates that the possibility of further communication is unlikely. Remove the outgoing SAs.
(The remote system may be a mobile node that is no longer present or powered on.)

</p>
<p>
After re-keying, transmission should switch to using the new
outgoing SAs (ISAKMP or IPsec) immediately, and the old leftover
outgoing SAs should be cleared out promptly (delete should be sent
for the outgoing SAs) rather than waiting for them to expire. This
reduces clutter and minimizes confusion for the operator doing diagnostics.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;Impacts on IKE</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor32">4.1</a>&nbsp;ISAKMP/IKE protocol</h4>

<p>
    The IKE wire protocol needs no modifications. The major changes are
    implementation issues relating to how the proposals are interpreted, and from
    whom they may come.
    
</p>
<p>
    As opportunistic encryption is designed to be useful between peers without
    prior operator configuration, an IKE daemon must be prepared to negotiate
    phase 1 SAs with any node. This may require a large amount of resources to 
    maintain cookie state, as well as large amounts of entropy for nonces,
    cookies and so on. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The major changes to support opportunistic encryption are at the IKE daemon
    level. These changes relate to handling of key acquisition requests, lookup
    of public keys and TXT records, and interactions with firewalls and other
    security facilities that may be co-resident on the same gateway.
    
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor33">4.2</a>&nbsp;Gateway discovery process</h4>

<p>
  In a typical configured tunnel, the address of SG-B is provided
  via configuration. Furthermore, the mapping of an SPD entry to a gateway is
  typically a 1:1 mapping. When the 0.0.0.0/0 SPD entry technique is used, then
  the mapping to a gateway is determined by the reverse DNS records.
  
</p>
<p>
  The need to do a DNS lookup and wait for a reply will typically introduce a
  new state and a new event source (DNS replies) to IKE. Although a
synchronous DNS request can be implemented for proof of concept, experience
is that it can cause very high latencies when a queue of queries must
all timeout in series. 
  
</p>
<p> 
  Use of an asynchronous DNS lookup will also permit overlap of DNS lookups with
  some of the protocol steps.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor34">4.3</a>&nbsp;Self identification</h4>

<p>
     SG-A will have to establish its identity. Use an
     IPv4 ID in phase 1. 
  
</p>
<p> There are many situations where the administrator of SG-A may not be
      able to control the reverse DNS records for SG-A's public IP address.
      Typical situations include dialup connections and most residential-type broadband Internet access 
      (ADSL, cable-modem) connections. In these situations, a fully qualified domain
      name that is under the control of SG-A's administrator may be used
      when acting as an initiator only.
      The FQDN ID should be used in phase 1. See <a href="#fqdn">Section 5.3</a>
      for more details and restrictions.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor35">4.4</a>&nbsp;Public key retrieval process</h4>

<p>
     Upon receipt of a phase 1 SA proposal with either an IPv4 (IPv6) ID or
     an FQDN ID, an IKE daemon needs to examine local caches and
     configuration files to determine if this is part of a configured tunnel.
     If no configured tunnels are found, then the implementation should attempt to retrieve
     a KEY record from the reverse DNS in the case of an IPv4/IPv6 ID, or 
     from the forward DNS in the case of FQDN ID.
  
</p>
<p> 
     It is reasonable that if other non-local sources of policy are used
     (COPS, LDAP), they be consulted concurrently but some
     clear ordering of policy be provided. Note that due to variances in
     latency, implementations must wait for positive or negative replies from all sources
     of policy before making any decisions.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor36">4.5</a>&nbsp;Interactions with DNSSEC</h4>

<p>
     The implementation described (1.98) neither uses DNSSEC directly to
     explicitly verify the authenticity of zone information, nor uses the NXT
     records to provide authentication of the absence of a TXT or KEY
     record. Rather, this implementation uses a trusted path to a DNSSEC
     capable caching resolver. 
  
</p>
<p> 
     To distinguish between an authenticated and an unauthenticated DNS
     resource record, a stub resolver capable of returning DNSSEC
     information MUST be used.

	of: 3DES, HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1, DH group 2 or 5. Group 5 SHOULD be
	proposed first. (See <a href="#RFC3526" title="Kivinen, T. and M. Kojo, More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for Internet Key Exchange (IKE), May 2003."quot;">[RFC3526]</a>)

<p>
	The initiator MAY offer additional proposals, but the cipher MUST not
	be weaker than 3DES. The initiator SHOULD limit the number of proposals
	such that the IKE datagrams do not need to be fragmented.
      
</p>
<p>
	The responder MUST accept one of the proposals. If any configuration
	of the responder is required then the responder is not acting in an
	opportunistic way. 
      
</p>
<p>
        The initiator SHOULD use an ID_IPV4_ADDR (ID_IPV6_ADDR for IPv6) of the external
        interface of the initiator for phase 1. (There is an exception, see <a href="#fqdn">Section 5.3</a>.) The authentication method MUST be RSA public key signatures. 
        The RSA key for the initiator SHOULD be placed into a DNS KEY record in
	the reverse space of the initiator (i.e. using in-addr.arpa or

<a name="rfc.section.5.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor39">5.2.1</a>&nbsp;Long TXT records</h4>

<p>
  When packed into wire-format, TXT records which are longer than 255
  characters are divided into smaller &lt;character-strings&gt;.
  (See <a href="#RFC1035" title="Mockapetris, P., Domain names - implementation and specification, November 1987."quot;">[RFC1035]</a> section 3.3 and 3.3.14.) These MUST
  be reassembled into a single string for processing.
  Whitespace characters in the base64 encoding are to be ignored.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor40">5.2.2</a>&nbsp;Choice of TXT record</h4>

<p>
	It has been suggested to use the KEY, OPT, CERT, or KX records
	instead of a TXT record. None is satisfactory.
  
</p>
<p> The KEY RR has a protocol field which could be used to indicate a new protocol, 
and an algorithm field which could be used to
        indicate different contents in the key data. However, the KEY record
	is clearly not intended for storing what are really authorizations,
	it is just for identities. Other uses have been discouraged.
  
</p>
<p> OPT resource records, as defined in <a href="#RFC2671" title="Vixie, P., Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0), August 1999."quot;">[RFC2671]</a> are not 
  intended to be used for storage of information. They are not to be loaded, 
	cached or forwarded.  They are, therefore, inappropriate for use here.
  
</p>
<p>
    CERT records <a href="#RFC2538" title="Eastlake, D. and O. Gudmundsson, Storing Certificates in the Domain Name System (DNS), March 1999."quot;">[RFC2538]</a> can encode almost any set of
    information. A custom type code could be used permitting any suitable
    encoding to be stored, not just X.509.  According to
    the RFC, the certificate RRs are to be signed internally which may add undesirable 
and unnecessary bulk. Larger DNS records may require TCP instead of UDP transfers.
  
</p>
<p>
    At the time of protocol design, the CERT RR was not widely deployed and
    could not be counted upon. Use of CERT records will be investigated,
    and may be proposed in a future revision of this document.
  
</p>
<p>
    KX records are ideally suited for use instead of TXT records, but had not been deployed at
    the time of implementation.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h4><a name="fqdn">5.3</a>&nbsp;Use of FQDN IDs</h4>

<p>
      Unfortunately, not every administrator has control over the contents
      of the reverse-map.  Where the initiator (SG-A) has no suitable reverse-map, the
      authorization record present in the reverse-map of Alice may refer to a
      FQDN instead of an IP address.
    
</p>
<p>
      In this case, the client's TXT record gives the fully qualified domain
      name (FQDN) in place of its security gateway's IP address. 
      The initiator should use the ID_FQDN ID-payload in phase 1.
      A forward lookup for a KEY record on the FQDN must yield the
      initiator's public key. 
    
</p>
<p>
      This method can also be used when the external address of SG-A is
      dynamic. 
    
</p>
<p>
      If SG-A is acting on behalf of Alice, then Alice must still delegate
      authority for SG-A to do so in her reverse-map. When Alice and SG-A
      are one and the same (i.e. Alice is acting as an end-node) then there
      is no need for this when initiating only. 
</p>
<p>However, Alice must still delegate to  herself if she wishes others to
       initiate OE to her.  See <a href="#txtfqdnformat">Figure 3</a>.
    
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor41">5.4</a>&nbsp;Key roll-over</h4>

<p>
Good cryptographic hygiene says that one should replace public/private key pairs
periodically. Some administrators may wish to do this as often as daily. Typical DNS
propagation delays are determined by the SOA Resource Record MINIMUM
parameter, which controls how long DNS replies may be cached. For reasonable
operation of DNS servers, administrators usually want this value to be at least several 
hours, sometimes as a long as a day. This presents a problem - a new key MUST
not be used prior to it propagating through DNS.

</p>
<p>
This problem is dealt with by having the Security Gateway generate a new
public/private key pair at least MINIMUM seconds in advance of using it. It
then adds this key to the DNS (both as a second KEY record and in additional TXT
delegation records) at key generation time. Note: only one key is allowed in
each TXT record.

</p>
<p>
When authenticating, all gateways MUST have available all public keys 
that are found in DNS for this entity. This permits the authenticating end
to check both the key for "today" and the key for "tomorrow". Note that it is 
the end which is creating the signature (possesses the private key) that
determines which key is to be used.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;Network address translation interaction</h3>

<p>
     There are no fundamentally new issues for implementing opportunistic encryption
     in the presence of network address translation. Rather there are 
     only the regular IPsec issues with NAT traversal.
  
</p>
<p>
     There are several situations to consider for NAT.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor43">6.1</a>&nbsp;Co-located NAT/NAPT</h4>

<p>
       If a security gateway is also performing network address translation on
       behalf of an end-system, then the packet should be translated prior to
       being subjected to opportunistic encryption. This is in contrast to
       typically configured tunnels which often exist to bridge islands of 
       private network address space. The security gateway will use the translated source
       address for phase 2, and so the responding security gateway will look up that address to
       confirm SG-A's authorization. 
    
</p>
<p> In the case of NAT (1:1), the address space into which the
        translation is done MUST be globally unique, and control over the
	reverse-map is assumed.
        Placing of TXT records is possible.
    
</p>
<p> In the case of NAPT (m:1), the address will be the security
        gateway itself. The ability to get
        KEY and TXT records in place will again depend upon whether or not
	there is administrative control over the reverse-map. This is
	identical to situations involving a single host acting on behalf of
	itself. 

	FQDN style can be used to get around a lack of a reverse-map for
	initiators only.
    
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor44">6.2</a>&nbsp;Security Gateway behind NAT/NAPT</h4>

<p>
       If there is a NAT or NAPT between the security gateways, then normal IPsec
       NAT traversal problems occur. In addition to the transport problem
       which may be solved by other mechanisms, there is the issue of
       what phase 1 and phase 2 IDs to use. While FQDN could
       be used during phase 1 for the security gateway, there is no appropriate ID for phase 2.
       Due to the NAT, the end systems live in different IP address spaces.
    
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.6.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor45">6.3</a>&nbsp;End System is behind a NAT/NAPT</h4>

<p>
       If the end system is behind a NAT (perhaps SG-B), then there is, in fact, no way for
       another end system to address a packet to this end system.
       Not only is opportunistic encryption
       impossible, but it is also impossible for any communication to
       be initiated to the end system. It may be possible for this end
       system to initiate such communication. This creates an asymmetry, but this is common for 
       NAPT.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;Host implementations</h3>

<p>
  When Alice and SG-A are components of the same system, they are
  considered to be a host implementation. The packet sequence scenario remains unchanged.

</p>
<p>
  Components marked Alice are the upper layers (TCP, UDP, the
  application), and SG-A is the IP layer.

</p>
<p>
  Note that tunnel mode is still required. 

</p>
<p>
  As Alice and SG-A are acting on behalf of themselves, no TXT based delegation
  record is necessary for Alice to initiate. She can rely on FQDN in a
  forward map. This is particularly attractive to mobile nodes such as 
  notebook computers at conferences.
  To respond, Alice/SG-A will still need an entry in Alice's reverse-map.

<a name="rfc.section.8"></a><h3>8.&nbsp;Multi-homing</h3>

<p> 
If there are multiple paths between Alice and Bob (as illustrated in
the diagram with SG-D), then additional DNS records are required to establish
authorization. 

</p>
<p>
In <a href="#networkdiagram">Figure 1</a>, Alice has two ways to
exit her network: SG-A and SG-D. Previously SG-D has been ignored. Postulate
that there are routers between Alice and her set of security gateways
(denoted by the + signs and the marking of an autonomous system number for
Alice's network). Datagrams may, therefore, travel to either SG-A or SG-D en
route to Bob.

</p>
<p>
As long as all network connections are in good order, it does not matter how
datagrams exit Alice's network. When they reach either security gateway, the
security gateway will find the TXT delegation record in Bob's reverse-map,
and establish an SA with SG-B. 

</p>
<p>
SG-B has no problem establishing that either of SG-A or SG-D may speak for
Alice, because Alice has published two equally weighted TXT delegation records:
    <br /><hr />
<a name="txtmultiexample"></a>
</p>
<pre>
X-IPsec-Server(10)=192.1.1.5 AQMM...3s1Q==

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Multiple gateway delegation example for Alice&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr size="1" shade="0">

</p>
<p>
Alice's routers can now do any kind of load sharing needed. Both SG-A and SG-D send datagrams addressed to Bob through
their tunnel to SG-B. 

</p>
<p>
Alice's use of non-equal weight delegation records to show preference of one gateway over another, has relevance only when SG-B 
is initiating to Alice. 

</p>
<p>
If the precedences are the same, then SG-B has a more difficult time. It
must decide which of the two tunnels to use. SG-B has no information about
which link is less loaded, nor which security gateway has more cryptographic
resources available. SG-B, in fact, has no knowledge of whether both gateways
are even reachable.  

</p>
<p>
The Public Internet's default-free zone may well know a good route to Alice,
but the datagrams that SG-B creates must be addressed to either SG-A or SG-D;
they can not be addressed to Alice directly.

</p>
<p>
SG-B may make a number of choices:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>It can ignore the problem and round robin among the tunnels. This
      causes losses during times when one or the other security gateway is
      unreachable. If this worries Alice, she can change the weights in her
      TXT delegation records.
</li>
<li>It can send to the gateway from which it most recently received datagrams. 
      This assumes that routing and reachability are symmetrical.
</li>
<li>It can listen to BGP information from the Internet to decide which
      system is currently up. This is clearly much more complicated, but if SG-B is already participating
      in the BGP peering system to announce Bob, the results data may already
      be available to it. 
</li>
<li>It can refuse to negotiate the second tunnel. (It is unclear whether or
not this is even an option.)
</li>
<li>It can silently replace the outgoing portion of the first tunnel with the
second one while still retaining the incoming portions of both. SG-B can,
thus, accept datagrams from either SG-A or SG-D, but
send only to the gateway that most recently re-keyed with it.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Local policy determines which choice SG-B makes. Note that even if SG-B has perfect
knowledge about the reachability of SG-A and SG-D, Alice may not be reachable
from either of these security gateways because of internal reachability
issues. 

</p>
<p>
FreeS/WAN implements option 5.  Implementing a different option is
being considered. The multi-homing aspects of OE are not well developed and may
be the subject of a future document.

<a name="rfc.section.9"></a><h3>9.&nbsp;Failure modes</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.9.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor49">9.1</a>&nbsp;DNS failures</h4>

<p>
  If a DNS server fails to respond, local policy decides
  whether or not to permit communication in the clear as embodied in
  the connection classes in <a href="#initclasses">Section 3.2</a>.
  It is easy to mount a denial of service attack on the DNS server
  responsible for a particular network's reverse-map.
  Such an attack may cause all communication with that network to go in
  the clear if the policy is permissive, or fail completely 
  if the policy is paranoid. Please note that this is an active attack.
  
</p>
<p>
  There are still many networks
  that do not have properly configured reverse-maps. Further, if the policy is not to communicate,
  the above denial of service attack isolates the target network. Therefore, the decision of whether 
or not to permit communication in the clear MUST be a matter of local policy.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor50">9.2</a>&nbsp;DNS configured, IKE failures</h4>

<p>
  DNS records claim that opportunistic encryption should
  occur, but the target gateway either does not respond on port 500, or
  refuses the proposal. This may be because of a crash or reboot, a
  faulty configuration, or a firewall filtering port 500.  
  
</p>
<p>
  The receipt of ICMP port, host or network unreachable
  messages indicates a potential problem, but MUST NOT cause communication
  to fail 
  immediately. ICMP messages are easily forged by attackers. If such a
  forgery caused immediate failure, then an active attacker could easily
  prevent any 
  encryption from ever occurring, possibly preventing all communication.
  
</p>
<p>
  In these situations a clear log should be produced
  and local policy should dictate if communication is then
  permitted in the clear.
  
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor51">9.3</a>&nbsp;System reboots</h4>

<p>
Tunnels sometimes go down because the remote end crashes,
disconnects, or has a network link break.  In general there is no
notification of this.  Even in the event of a crash and successful reboot, 
other SGs don't hear about it unless the rebooted SG has specific 
reason to talk to them immediately.  Over-quick response to temporary 
network outages is undesirable.  Note that a tunnel can be torn
down and then re-established without any effect visible to the user
except a pause in traffic. On the other hand, if one end reboots,
the other end can't get datagrams to it at all (except via
IKE) until the situation is noticed.  So a bias toward quick
response is appropriate even at the cost of occasional
false alarms.

</p>
<p>
A mechanism for recovery after reboot is a topic of current research and is not specified in this
document.

</p>
<p>
A deliberate shutdown should include an attempt, using delete
messagess, to notify all other SGs currently connected by phase 1 SAs
that communication is about to fail.  Again, a remote SG will assume
this is a teardown.  Attempts by the remote SGs to negotiate new
tunnels as replacements should be ignored. When possible,  SGs should
attempt to preserve information about currently-connected SGs in
non-volatile storage, so that after a crash, an Initial-Contact can be
sent to previous partners to indicate loss of all previously
established connections.

<a name="rfc.section.12"></a><h3>12.&nbsp;Security considerations</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.12.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor57">12.1</a>&nbsp;Configured vs opportunistic tunnels</h4>

<p>
    Configured tunnels are those which are setup using bilateral mechanisms: exchanging 
public keys (raw RSA, DSA, PKIX), pre-shared secrets, or by referencing keys that
are in known places (distinguished name from LDAP, DNS). These keys are then used to
configure a specific tunnel. 

</p>
<p>
A pre-configured tunnel may be on all the time, or may be keyed only when needed. 
The end points of the tunnel are not necessarily static: many mobile
applications (road warrior) are considered to be configured tunnels. 

</p>
<p>
The primary characteristic is that configured tunnels are assigned specific
security properties. They may be trusted in different ways relating to exceptions to 
firewall rules, exceptions to NAT processing, and to bandwidth or other quality of service restrictions. 

</p>
<p>
Opportunistic tunnels are not inherently trusted in any strong way. They are
created without prior arrangement. As the two parties are strangers, there
MUST be no confusion of datagrams that arrive from opportunistic peers and
those that arrive from configured tunnels. A security gateway MUST take care
that an opportunistic peer can not impersonate a configured peer.

</p>
<p>
Ingress filtering MUST be used to make sure that only datagrams authorized by
negotiation (and the concomitant authentication and authorization) are
accepted from a tunnel. This is to prevent one peer from impersonating another. 

</p>
<p>
An implementation suggestion is to treat opportunistic tunnel
datagrams as if they arrive on a logical interface distinct from other
configured tunnels. As the number of opportunistic tunnels that may be
created automatically on a system is potentially very high, careful attention 
to scaling should be taken into account.

</p>
<p>
As with any IKE negotiation, opportunistic encryption cannot be secure
without authentication. Opportunistic encryption relies on DNS for its
authentication information and, therefore, cannot be fully secure without
a secure DNS. Without secure DNS, opportunistic encryption can protect against passive
eavesdropping but not against active man-in-the-middle attacks.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.12.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor58">12.2</a>&nbsp;Firewalls versus Opportunistic Tunnels</h4>

<p>
  Typical usage of per datagram access control lists is to implement various
kinds of security gateways. These are typically called "firewalls". 

</p>
<p>
  Typical usage of a virtual private network (VPN) within a firewall is to
bypass all or part of the access controls between two networks. Additional
trust (as outlined in the previous section) is given to datagrams that arrive
in the VPN.

</p>
<p> 
  Datagrams that arrive via opportunistically configured tunnels MUST not be
trusted. Any security policy that would apply to a datagram arriving in the
clear SHOULD also be applied to datagrams arriving opportunistically.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.12.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor59">12.3</a>&nbsp;Denial of service</h4>

<p>
  There are several different forms of denial of service that an implementor 
  should be concerned with. Most of these problems are shared with
  security gateways that have large numbers of mobile peers (road warriors). 

</p>
<p>
  The design of ISAKMP/IKE, and its use of cookies, defend against many kinds
  of denial of service. Opportunism changes the assumption that if the phase 1 (ISAKMP) 
  SA is authenticated, that it was worthwhile creating. Because the gateway will communicate with any machine, it is
  possible to form phase 1 SAs with any machine on the Internet.
