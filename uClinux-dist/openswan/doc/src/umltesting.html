<h1><a name="umltesting">User-Mode-Linux Testing guide</a></h1>

<p>
User mode linux is a way to compile a linux kernel such that it can run as a
process in another linux system (potentially as a *BSD or Windows process
later). See <A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/</A>
</P>

<p>
UML is a good platform for testing and experimenting with FreeS/WAN.
It allows several network nodes to be simulated on a single machine.
Creating, configuring, installing, monitoring, and controling these
nodes is generally easier and easier to script with UML than real
hardware.
</p>

<p>
You'll need about 500Mb of disk space for a full sunrise-east-west-sunset
setup. You can possibly get this down by 130Mb if you remove the
sunrise/sunset kernel build. If you just want to run, then you can even
remove the east/west kernel build.
</p>
<p>
Nothing need be done as super user.  In a couple of steps, we note
where super user is required to install commands in system-wide
directories, but ~/bin could be used instead.  UML seems to use a
system-wide /tmp/uml directory so different users may interfere with
one another. Later UMLs use ~/.uml instead, so multiple users running UML 
tests should not be a problem, but note that a single user running
the UML tests will only be able run one set. Further, UMLs sometimes
get stuck and hang around. These "zombies" (most will actually be in
the "T" state in the process table) will interfere with subsequent tests.
</P>

<H2>Preliminary Notes on BIND</H2>

<P>
As of 2005/10/31, the Light-Weight Resolver is used by pluto.
This requires that BIND9 be running.
Since previous versions, the bind9.3 has been released and is therefore far more likely to be available. To make sure that we have appropriate libraries,
we have actually imported the relevant code from bind 9.3.
</P>

<H2>Steps to Install UML for FreeS/WAN</H2>
<OL>
<LI> Get the following files:
<OL type="a">
<LI> from <A HREF="rsync://anoncvs.openswan.org/">rsync://anoncvs.openswan.org/rootfstar/</A>
umlswanroot-26.tar.gz (or highest numbered one). This is originally a
  debian potato root file system, but has many upgrades and should work
  on any recent (debian sarge, FC4, etc.). 

<!-- If you are using
  Redhat 7.2 or newer as your development machine, you can create the
  image from your installation media. See <A HREF="uml-rhroot.html">Building a RedHat root"></A>.
  A future document will explain how to build this from .DEB files as well.
-->

<!--
<LI> umlfreesharemini.tar.gz    (or umlfreeshareall.tar.gz). 
  If you are a Debian potato user, you don't need it you can use your
  native /usr/share.
</UL>
-->

<LI> From <A HREF="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/">ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/</A>
a snapshot or release (1.92 or better)

<LI> From a
  <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">http://www.kernel.org mirror</A>,
  the virgin 2.4.19 kernel. Please realize that we have defaults in our
  tree for kernel configuration. We try to track the latest UML
  kernels. If you   use a newer kernel, you may have faults in the
  kernel build process. You can see what the latest that is being regularly tested by visiting <A HREF="http://bugs.freeswan.org:81/regress/HEAD/lastgood/freeswan-regress-env.sh">freeswan-regress-env.sh</A>.

<LI>
<!-- Note: this step is refered to as "step 1d" below. -->
Get
  <A HREF="http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/">http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/</A>
  uml-patch-2.4.30-1.bz2 or the one associated with your kernel. For 2.6 kernels after 2.6.10, you do not need any patches. We have tested up to 2.6.13.

<STRONG>More recent versions of the patch have not been tested by us.</STRONG>
<LI> You'll probably want to visit 
<A
  HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net">http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net</A> 
and get the UML utilities. These are not needed for the build or interactive use (but recommended). They are necessary for the regression testing procedures used by "make check". 
We currently use uml_utilities_20020212.tar.bz2.
<LI>
You need tcpdump version 3.7.1 or better.
This is newer than the version included in most LINUX distributions.
You can check the version of an installed tcpdump with the --version flag.
If you need a newer tcpdump
fetch both tcpdump and libpcap source tar files from 
<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">http://www.tcpdump.org/</A> or a mirror.
</OL>

<LI> Pick a suitable place, and extract the following files:
<OL type="a"> 
<LI>
<!-- Note: this step is refered to as "step 2a" later. -->
2.4.31 kernel. For instance:
<PRE>
<CODE>
           cd /c2/kernel
           tar xzvf ../download/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.31.tar.gz
</CODE>
</PRE>

<LI> extract the umlswanroot file 
<!-- (unless you <A HREF="uml-rhroot.html">built your own from RPMs</A>) -->
<PRE>
<CODE>
           mkdir -p /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           cd /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           tar xzvf ../download/umlswanroot-15.1.tar.gz
</CODE>
</PRE>

<LI> Openswan itself (or checkout "openswan-2" from CVS)
<PRE>
<CODE>
           mkdir -p /c2/openswan/sandbox
           cd /c2/openswan/sandbox
           tar xzvf ../download/openswan-2.4.2dr2.tar.gz
</CODE>
</PRE>
</OL>

<LI> If you need to build a newer tcpdump:
<UL>
<LI>
Make sure you have OpenSSL installed -- it is needed for cryptographic routines.
<LI>
Unpack libpcap and tcpdump source in parallel directories (the tcpdump
build procedures look for libpcap next door).
<LI>
Change directory into the libpcap source directory and then build the library:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	./configure
	make
</CODE>
</PRE>
<LI>
Change into the tcpdump source directory, build tcpdump, and install it.
<PRE>
<CODE>
	./configure
	make
	# Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
	# Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
	su -c "make install"
</CODE>
</PRE>
</UL>
<LI> If you need the uml utilities, unpack them somewhere then build and install
them:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	cd tools
	make all
	# Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
	# Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
	su -c "make install BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin"
</CODE>
</PRE>
<LI> set up the configuration file
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox/openswanswan-2.4.2dr2/testing/utils
</CODE>
<LI> copy umlsetup-sample.sh to ../../umlsetup.sh:
<CODE>
  cp umlsetup-sample.sh ../../umlsetup.sh
</CODE>

<LI> open up ../../umlsetup.sh in your favorite editor.
<LI> change POOLSPACE= to point to the place with at least 500Mb of
disk. Best if it is on the same partition as the "umlfreeroot" extraction,
as it will attempt to use hard links if possible to save  disk space.

<LI> Set TESTINGROOT if you intend to run the script outside of the
     sandbox/snapshot/release directory. Otherwise, it will configure itself.

<LI> KERNPOOL should point to the directory with your 2.4.19 kernel
   tree. This tree should be unconfigured! This is the directory
   you used in step 2a.

<LI> UMLPATCH should point at the bz2 file you downloaded at 1d.
   If using a kernel that already includes the patch, set this to /dev/null.
 
<LI> FREESWANDIR should point at the directory where you unpacked
               the snapshot/release. Include the "freeswan-snap2001sep16b"
               or whatever in it. If you are running from CVS, then
               you point at the directory where top, klips, etc. are.
               The script will fix up the directory so that it can be
               used.

<LI> BASICROOT should be set to the directory used in 2b, or to the directory
  that you created with RPMs.

<LI> SHAREDIR should be set to the directory used in 2c, to /usr/share
             for Debian potato users, or to $BASICROOT/usr/share.
</UL>

<LI> <PRE><CODE>
make uml
</CODE></PRE>
    It will grind for awhile. If there are errors it will bail.
    If so, run it under "script" and send the output to bugs@lists.freeswan.org.  

<LI> You will have a bunch of stuff under $POOLSPACE.
    Open four xterms:

<PRE><CODE>
    for i in sunrise sunset east west
    do
        xterm -name $i -title $i -e $POOLSPACE/$i/start.sh &
    done
</CODE></PRE>

<LI> Login as root. Password is "root"
    (Note, these virtual machines are networked together, but are not
    configured to talk to the rest of the world.)

<LI> verify that pluto started on east/west, run "ipsec look"

<LI> login to sunrise. run "ping sunset"

<LI> login to west. run "tcpdump -p -i eth1 -n"
    (tcpdump must be version 3.7.1 or newer)

<LI> Closing a console xterm will shut down that UML.

<LI> You can "make check", if you want to.
It is run from /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97.</LI>

</OL>

<H1>Debugging the kernel with GDB</H1>

<P>
With User-Mode-Linux, you can debug the kernel using GDB.
See <HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html">http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html</A>.
</P>

<P>
Typically, one will want to address a test case for a failing situation.
Running GDB from Emacs, or from other front ends is possible. First start GDB.
</P>
<P>
Tell it to open the UMLPOOL/swan/linux program.
</P>
<P>
Note the PID of GDB:
<PRE>
marajade-[projects/freeswan/mgmt/planning] mcr 1029 %ps ax | grep gdb
 1659 pts/9    SN     0:00 /usr/bin/gdb -fullname -cd /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch/UMLPOOL/swan/ linux
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Set the following in the environment:
<PRE>
UML_east_OPT="debug gdb-pid=1659"
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Then start the user-mode-linux in the test scheme you wish:
<PRE>
marajade-[kernpatch/testing/klips/east-icmp-02] mcr 1220 %../../utils/runme.sh
</PRE>

The user-mode-linux will stop on boot, giving you a chance to attach to the process:

<PRE>
(gdb) file linux
Reading symbols from linux...done.
(gdb) attach 1
Attaching to program: /mara4/freeswan/kernpatch/UMLPOOL/swan/linux, process 1
0xa0118bc1 in kill () at hostfs_kern.c:770
</PRE>

<P>
At this point, break points should be created as appropriate.
</P>

<H2>Other notes about debugging</H2>

<P>
If you are running a standard test, after all the packets are sent, the UML will
be shutdown. This can cause problems, because the UML may get terminated while you
are debugging.
</P>
<P>
The environment variable <CODE>NETJIGWAITUSER</CODE> can be set to "waituser".
If so, then the testing system will prompt before exiting the test.
</P>

<P>
The environment variable <CODE>UML_GETTY</CODE> if set, will cause each UML
to spawn a getty on /dev/tty1, and will wait for it to exit before continuing.

<P>
The environment variable <CODE>UML_SLEEP</CODE> can be set to some shell
code. It will be invoked at the end of each UML run. In general, this
is used in interactive UML use, so that the window in which the UML
was running won't close immediately. While a good value should be:
"echo press enter; read ans", something about the way the UML exits when it
panics (oops) means that the tty is too broken for this to work, so use "sleep 180" instead.
</P>

<H1>User-Mode-Linux mysteries</H1>

<UL>
<LI> running more than one UML of the same name (e.g. "west") can cause
  problems.
<LI> running more than one UML from the same root file system is not
  a good idea.
<LI> all this means that running "make check" twice on the same machine
  is probably not a good idea.
<LI> occationally, UMLs will get stuck. This can happen like:
<BLOCK>
15134 ?        T      0:00 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east) [/bin/sh]           
15138 ?        T      0:00 /spare/hugh/uml/uml2.4.18-sept5/umlbuild/east/linux (east) [halt]              
 </BLOCK>

these will need to be killed. Note that they are in "T"racing mode.
<LI> UMLs can also hang, and will report "Tracing myself and I can't get out".
This is a bug in UML. There are ways to find out what is going on and
report this to the UML people, but we don't know the magic right now.
</UL>

<H1>Getting more info from uml_netjig</H1>

<P>
uml_netjig can be compiled with a built-in tcpdump. This uses not-yet-released
code from <A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">www.tcpdump.org</A>.
Please see the instructions in <CODE>testing/utils/uml_netjig/Makefile</CODE>.
