Known issues with Openswan on a 2.6 kernel
-------------------------------------------

The Openswan userland can now use either KLIPS or NETKEY as the kernel
level IPsec stack.

This is an overview of known issues with Openswan on the 2.6 kernel codebase
(also 2.5.x), which includes NETKEY (CONFIG_NET_KEY).

* 2.6.18 (but not 2.6.18.1) seems to fail for NETKEY in combination with
  NAT-Traversal.

* 2.6.19 and 2.6.20 cause crashers with NAT-Traversal

* pluto[709]: initiate on demand from 172.18.1.37:0 to 172.23.1.5:0 proto=0
  state: fos_start because: acquire

  Netkey does not have %hold operations. It is a serious design bug that
  KAME also has. It also does not rate limit messages from the kernel to
  userspace. This means that each packet that wanted to go into a tunnel
  causes an acquire from the kernel to userspace.
  Each acquire that the keying daemon gets causes it to initiate a connection.
  We could rate limit them in some fashion, but we need to be cautious about
  doing that. Please file a bug with your supplier of your kernel. 

* The iproute2 (sometimes called iproute) package, as of version 2.6.8, 
  contains XFRM support (ip xfrm), obsoleting the use of the 'setkey' command
  from the ipsec-tools package. 
  If for some reason you cannot use iproute >= 2.6.8 on your kernel, you can
  still use the fallback method of using 'setkey' from the ipsec-tools
  package which is available at: http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net/

* 'ip xfrm state' has been reported hanging in uninterruptable sleep, 
  causing Openswan to hang (eg during shutdown)

* Openswan-2 ships with support for NETKEY.
  Many thanks to Herbert Xu for the initial code patches.

* setkey doesn't like spaces in PSK's from ipsec.secrets.  If you are on a recent
  distro with 'ip xfrm' support, or using KLIPS, this isn't a problem.

* Use the most recent Linux Openswan-2 release from ftp.openswan.org
  to try our 2.6 kernel support. Currently, this is 2.3.1

* If you wish to use KLIPS on 2.6, you need to build the KLIPS kernel
  module:

  make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux-2.6.x module minstall

On Fedora you can do:

  make KERNELSRC=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build module minstall

* Preload the ipsec stack you wish to use before starting Openswan.
  Use 'modprobe af_key' for NETKEY and 'modprobe ipsec' for KLIPS.

* To install the userland: make programs install

* Please see the dev and users mailing lists for more detail and the latest
  reports.  (http://lists.openswan.org/)


DESIGN-RELATED ISSUES


* In 2.6, IPsec policies are detached from routing decisions. Because of this
  design, Opportunistic Encryption on the local LAN will be possible with 2.6.

  One side effect: When contacting a node on the local LAN which is protected
  by gateway OE, you will get asymmetrical routing (one way through the gateway,
  one way direct), and IPsec will drop the return packets.



CURRENT ISSUES

* There are versioning problems with the current klips module on 2.6.9,
  kernel: ipsec: no version for "struct_module" found: kernel tainted.

* Fedora Core 2/3's gcc and 2.3.0dr4 KLIPS causes crashers and lock ups.

* OE with the NETKEY stack is broken. You will notice errors like:
  pluto[11081]: %hold otherwise handled during DNS lookup for Opportunistic
  Initiation for 193.110.157.17 to 208.245.212.67
  while your command that triggered the OE connection shows:
  connect: Resource temporarily unavailable

* DPD restarts might cause packet loss (see previous item)

* There are crashers in xfrm_user in kernels < 2.6.3-rc1. These will happen
  after the connection goes up and down a few times in quick succession.
  [ There is currently a bug in the rekeying code that triggers this ]

* starting with 2.6.9 NETKEY needs to have xfrm4_tunnel support. You might need
  to modprobe this on older Openswan versions.

* Using SNAT and the 2.6 ipsec code apparently doesn't go well together.
  Reported by Alexander Samad. Known issue for the netfilter team. DNAT
  works as usual, meaning you have to exlude DNAT'ing packets meant for
  a tunnel. Suse currently has some patches that fixes the SNAT issue, but
  this is untested by us so far. Some patches made it into 2.6.11.7 and
  2.6.12-rc3.

* For the moment, users wishing to run Openswan with NETKEY will require
  the ipsec-tools package "setkey" program. Though Openswan's keying daemon,
  Pluto, directly sets IPsec policy, setkey is currently required to view and
  reset kernel SPD (Security Policy Database) states when Pluto restarts. We
  will likely add this basic functionality to an upcoming Openswan release.

* State information is not available to the user, eg. ipsec eroute, ipsec spi
  and ipsec look do not fully work. The exception: ipsec auto --status
  This will be fixed in a future release.
  A quickly hacked perl script by Ken Bantoft, can emulate the 'eroute' command
  behaviour under NETKEY, see: http://www.xtdnet.nl/paul/eroute

* If you're running Opportunistic Encryption, connectivity to new hosts will
  immediately fail. You may receive a message similar to this:

     connect: Resource temporarily unavailable

  The reason for this lies in the kernel code. Fairly complex discussion:

      http://lists.freeswan.org/archives/design/2003-September/msg00073.html

  As of 2.6.9, this has not been fixed.

* This initial connectivity failure has an unintended side effect on DNS
  queries. This will result in a rekey failure for OE connections; a %pass
  will be installed for your destination IP before a %pass is re-instituted
  to your DNS server. As a workaround, please add your DNS servers to
  /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear.

* Packets on all interfaces are considered for OE, including loopback. If you
  are running a local nameserver, you'll still need to exempt localhost DNS
  traffic as per the previous point. Since this traffic has a source of
  127.0.0.1/32, the "clear" policy group will not suffice; you'll need to add
  the following %passthrough conn to ipsec.conf:

  conn exclude-lo
          authby=never
          left=127.0.0.1
          leftsubnet=127.0.0.0/8
          right=127.0.0.2
          rightsubnet=127.0.0.0/8
          type=passthrough
          auto=route
