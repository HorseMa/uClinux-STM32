Note that trap_count is only supported on the classic KLIPS stack\&. It is not supported on any other stack and will be completely removed in future versions\&. A replacement command still needs to be designed

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fI/proc/net/ipsec/stats/trap_count\fR is a read\-only file\&. It contains a hexadecimal number which records the number of attempts to send PF_ACQUIRE messages\&. Only those recorded by trap_sendcount were actually successfully passed to userland\&. Note that the userland may still have lost them on its own\&.
