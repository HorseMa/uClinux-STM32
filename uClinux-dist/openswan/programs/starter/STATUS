The starter code was ported to FreeSWAN 2.05, but the work was not 
completed. This code depends upon changes to pluto, which are have not
been done in Openswan.

This needs to be tested, and have scripts for the regression testing
system written.

	* Added support for xauth, aggr mode, mode config and dpd parameters
	* Added confwrite.h, so we can call the confwrite() function
		Still won't link due to the way stuffin keywords.h is declared.
		There has to be a better way of doing the declarations, but I
		haven't figured it out yet.
	* Added netkey (26 native stack) support for modules.  We currently
	  don't have an simple KLIPS vs. NETKEY test in starter, so it attempts
	  to do both in several places.
