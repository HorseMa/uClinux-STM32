.SH "OBSOLETE"

.PP
Note that starter is being obsoleted for the new connection loading code that replace all the scripts, and will be removed from Openswan in the next major release\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Openswan Starter is aimed to replace all the scripts which are used to start and stop Openswan, and to do that in a quicker and a smarter way\&.

.PP
It can also reload the configuration file if given a HUP\fI signal, and apply the changes\&.\fR

.PP
What it will do:

.PP
Load and unload KLIPS, or NETKEY (ipsec kernel module)

.PP
Launch and monitor pluto\&.

.PP
Add, initiate, route and delete connections

.PP
Attach and detach interfaces according to config file

.PP
kill \-HUP can be used to reload the config file\&. New connections will be added, old ones will be removed and modified ones will be reloaded\&. Interfaces/Klips/Pluto will be reloaded if necessary\&.

.PP
Upon startup, starter will save its pid to the file /var/run/pluto/ipsec\-starter\&.pid

.PP
Upon reloading, dynamic DNS addresses will be resolved and updated\&. Use \-\-auto_reload to periodicaly check for dynamic DNS changes\&.

.PP
kill \-USR1 can be used to reload all connections\&. This does a \fIdelete\fR, followed by an \fIadd\fR and then either a \fIroute\fR or \fIinitiate\fR operation\&.

.PP
/var/run/pluto/dynip/xxxx can be used to use a virtual interface name in ipsec\&.conf\&. By example, when adsl can be ppp0, ppp1, or some such, one can do:

.PP
\fIipsec\&.conf: interfaces="ipsec0=adsl\fR And use /etc/ppp/ip\-up to create /var/run/pluto/dynip/adsl /var/run/pluto/dynip/adsl: IP_PHYS=ppp0

.PP
%auto can be used to automaticaly name the connections

.PP
kill \-TERM can be used to stop Openswan\&. Pluto will be stopped and kernel modules unloaded\&.
