# CAUTION:  Installing a new version of Openswan will install a new
# copy of this script, wiping out any custom changes you make.  If
# you need changes, make a copy of this under another name, and customize
# that, and use the (left/right)updown= parameters in ipsec.conf to make
# Openswan use yours instead of this default one.

# things that this script gets (from ipsec_pluto(8) man page)
#
#
#      PLUTO_VERSION
#              indicates  what  version of this interface is being
#              used.  This document describes version  1.1.   This
#              is upwardly compatible with version 1.0.
#
#       PLUTO_VERB
#              specifies the name of the operation to be performed
#              (prepare-host, prepare-client, up-host, up-client,
#              down-host, or down-client).  If the address family
#              for security gateway to security gateway communications
#              is IPv6, then a suffix of -v6 is added to the
#              verb.
#
#       PLUTO_CONNECTION
#              is the name of the  connection  for  which  we  are
#              routing.
#
#       PLUTO_CONN_POLICY
#              the policy of the connection, as in:
#     RSASIG+ENCRYPT+TUNNEL+PFS+DONTREKEY+OPPORTUNISTIC+failureDROP+lKOD+rKOD  
#
#       PLUTO_NEXT_HOP
#              is the next hop to which packets bound for the peer
#              must be sent.
#
#       PLUTO_INTERFACE
#              is the name of the ipsec interface to be used.
#
#       PLUTO_ME
#              is the IP address of our host.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_CLIENT
#              is the IP address / count of our client subnet.  If
#              the  client  is  just  the  host,  this will be the
#              host's own IP address / max (where max  is  32  for
#              IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#       PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_NET
#              is the IP address of our client net.  If the client
#              is just the host, this will be the  host's  own  IP
#              address.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_MASK
#              is  the  mask for our client net.  If the client is
#              just the host, this will be 255.255.255.255.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP
#              if non-empty, then the source address for the route will be
#              set to this IP address.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_PROTOCOL
#              is the protocol  for this  connection.  Useful  for
#              firewalling.
#
#       PLUTO_MY_PORT
#              is the port. Useful for firewalling.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER
#              is the IP address of our peer.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT
#              is the IP address / count of the peer's client subnet.
#              If the client is just the peer, this will be
#              the peer's own IP address / max (where  max  is  32
#              for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT_NET
#              is the IP address of the peer's client net.  If the
#              client is just the peer, this will  be  the  peer's
#              own IP address.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT_MASK
#              is  the  mask  for  the  peer's client net.  If the
#              client   is   just   the   peer,   this   will   be
#              255.255.255.255.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_PROTOCOL
#              is  the  protocol  set  for  remote  end  with port
#              selector.
#
#       PLUTO_PEER_PORT
#              is the peer's port. Useful for firewalling.
#
#       PLUTO_CONNECTION_TYPE
#
#	PLUTO_STACK
#		the kernel stack being used (eg protostack= value)

# Import default _updown configs from the /etc/sysconfig/pluto_updown file
#
# Two variables can be set in this file:
#
#       DEFAULTSOURCE
#              is the default value for PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP
#
#       IPROUTETABLE
#              is the default value for IPROUTETABLE
#
#       IPROUTEARGS
#              is the extra argument list for ip route command
#
#       IPRULEARGS
#              is the extra argument list for ip rule command
