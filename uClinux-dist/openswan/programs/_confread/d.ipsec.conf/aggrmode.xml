  <listitem>
<para>Use Aggressive Mode instead of Main Mode. Aggressive Mode is less secure,
and vulnerable to Denial Of Service attacks. It is also vulnerable to brute force
attacks with software such as <emphasis remap='B'>ikecrack</emphasis>. It should
not be used, and it should especially not be used with XAUTH and group secrets (PSK).
If the remote system administrator insists on staying irresponsible, enable this option.</para>
<para>Aggressive Mode is further limited to only one proposal - there is no room for
negotation. Therefor it is mandatory for Aggressive Mode connections that both
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='B'>esp=</emphasis> options are
specified with exactly one fully specified proposal.
Acceptable values are <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
(the default).</para>
