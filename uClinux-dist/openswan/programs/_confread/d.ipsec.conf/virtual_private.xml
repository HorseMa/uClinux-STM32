<para>contains the networks that are allowed as subnet= for the remote
client. In other words, the address ranges that may live behind a NAT
router through which a client connects.  This value is usually set to
all the RFC-1918 address space, excluding the space used in the local
subnet behind the NAT (An IP address cannot live at two places at once).
IPv4 address ranges are denoted as
<emphasis remap='I'>%v4:a.b.c.d/mm</emphasis>
and IPv6 is denoted as
<emphasis remap='I'>%v6:aaaa::bbbb:cccc:dddd:eeee/mm</emphasis>. One
can exclude subnets by using the <emphasis remap='B'>!</emphasis>.
For example, if the VPN server is giving access to 192.168.1.0/24,
this option should be set to:
<emphasis remap='I'>virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12,%v4:!192.168.1.0/24</emphasis>.
This parameter is only needed on the server side and not on the client side that resides behind the NAT router, as
the client will just use its IP address for the inner IP setting.
This parameter may eventually become per-connection.
