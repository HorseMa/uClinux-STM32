.SH NAME
ipsec _confread \- internal routing to parse config file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fI_confread\fR is an internal script used for parsing /etc/ipsec\&.conf into a canonical format\&.

.SH "OBSOLETE"

.PP
\fI_confread\fR is going to be obsoleted in the next major release of Openswan in favour of the \fIaddcon\fR code\&. The new code will load all the connections much faster then the current scripts that can takes minutes to load a few hunderd conns, and requires awk and sed commands not always available in their full versions, such as with busybox on embedded platforms\&. The old alternative to this called \fIstarter\fR will also be removed as obsolete for the new \fIaddcon\fR code\&.
