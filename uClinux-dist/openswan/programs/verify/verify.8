.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
Invoked without argument, \fIverify\fR examines the local system for a number of common system faults: IPsec not in path, no secrets file generated, pluto not running, and IPsec support not present in kernel (or IPsec module not loaded)\&. If two or more interfaces are found, it performs checks relevant on an IPsec gateway: whether IP forwarding is allowed, and if so, whether MASQ or NAT rules are in play\&. It also checks a number of kernel internals in /proc for sane values\&.

.PP
In addition, \fIverify\fR performs checks relevant to Opportunistic Encryption\&. It looks in forward DNS for a TXT record for the system's hostname, and in reverse DNS for a TXT record for the system's IP addresses\&. It checks whether the system has a public IP\&.

.PP
The \fB\-\-host\fR option causes \fIverify\fR to look for a TXT record for \fIname\fR in forward and reverse DNS\&.

.SH "BUGS"

\fIVerify\fR does not look for TXT records for Opportunistic clients behind the system\&.
