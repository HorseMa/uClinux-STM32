.SH "NAME"
ipsec newhostkey - generate a new raw RSA authentication key for a host
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 6
\fBipsec\fR \fInewhostkey\fR [[\-\-quiet] | [\-\-verbose]] [\-\-bits\ \fIbits\fR] [\-\-hostname\ \fIhostname\fR] \-\-output\ \fIfilename\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fInewhostkey\fR
outputs (into
\fIfilename\fR, which can be \'\-\' for standard output) an RSA private key suitable for this host, in
\fI/etc/ipsec\.secrets\fR
format (see
\fBipsec.secrets\fR(5)) using the
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option per default\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-output\fR
option is mandatory\. The specified
\fIfilename\fR
is created under umask
\fB077\fR
if nonexistent; if it already exists and is non\-empty, a warning message about that is sent to standard error, and the output is appended to the file\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option suppresses both the
\fIrsasigkey\fR
narrative and the existing\-file warning message\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-bits\fR
option specifies the number of bits in the key; the current default is 2192 and we do not recommend use of anything shorter unless unusual constraints demand it\.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-hostname\fR
option is passed through to
\fIrsasigkey\fR
to tell it what host name to label the output with (via its
\fB\-\-hostname\fR
option)\.
.PP
The output format is that of
\fIrsasigkey\fR, with bracketing added to complete the
\fIipsec\.secrets\fR
format\. In the usual case, where
\fIipsec\.secrets\fR
contains only the host\(^as own private key, the output of
\fInewhostkey\fR
is sufficient as a complete
\fIipsec\.secrets\fR
file\.

.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project <\fIhttp://www\.freeswan\.org\fR> by Henry Spencer\.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
As with
\fIrsasigkey\fR, the run time is difficult to predict, since depletion of the system\(^as randomness pool can cause arbitrarily long waits for random bits, and the prime\-number searches can also take unpre dictable (and potentially large) amounts of CPU time\. See
\fBipsec_rsasigkey\fR(8)
for some typical performance numbers\.
.PP
A higher\-level tool which could handle the clerical details of changing to a new key would be helpful\.
.PP
The requirement for
\fB\-\-output\fR
is a blemish, but private keys are extremely sensitive information and unusual precautions seem justified\.
