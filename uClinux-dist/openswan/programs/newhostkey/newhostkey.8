.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fInewhostkey\fR outputs (into \fIfilename\fR, which can be '\-' for standard output) an RSA private key suitable for this host, in \fI/etc/ipsec\&.secrets\fR format (see \fBipsec\&.secrets\fR(5)) using the \fB\-\-quiet\fR option per default\&.

.PP
The \fB\-\-output\fR option is mandatory\&. The specified \fIfilename\fR is created under umask \fI077\fR if nonexistent; if it already exists and is non\-empty, a warning message about that is sent to standard error, and the output is appended to the file\&.

.PP
The \fB\-\-quiet\fR option suppresses both the \fIrsasigkey\fR narrative and the existing\-file warning message\&.

.PP
The \fB\-\-bits\fR option specifies the number of bits in the key; the current default is 2192 and we do not recommend use of anything shorter unless unusual constraints demand it\&.

.PP
The \fB\-\-hostname\fR option is passed through to \fIrsasigkey\fR to tell it what host name to label the output with (via its \fB\-\-hostname\fR option)\&.

.PP
The output format is that of \fIrsasigkey\fR, with bracketing added to complete the \fIipsec\&.secrets\fR format\&. In the usual case, where \fIipsec\&.secrets\fR contains only the hostâs own private key, the output of \fInewhostkey\fR is sufficient as a complete \fIipsec\&.secrets\fR file\&.

.SH "HISTORY"

.PP
Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project <http://www\&.freeswan\&.org: \fIhttp://www.freeswan.org\fR> by Henry Spencer\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
As with \fIrsasigkey\fR, the run time is difficult to predict, since depletion of the systemâs randomness pool can cause arbitrarily long waits for random bits, and the prime\-number searches can also take unpre dictable (and potentially large) amounts of CPU time\&. See \fBipsec_rsasigkey\fR(8) for some typical performance numbers\&.

.PP
A higher\-level tool which could handle the clerical details of changing to a new key would be helpful\&.

.PP
The requirement for \fB\-\-output\fR is a blemish, but private keys are extremely sensitive information and unusual precautions seem justified\&.
