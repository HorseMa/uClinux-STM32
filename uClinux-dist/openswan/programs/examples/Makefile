# $Log: Makefile,v $
# Revision 1.3.6.4  2007-11-02 16:12:25  paul
# Remove deleted targets from Makefile (old examples)
#
# Revision 1.3.6.3  2007/02/21 00:48:02  paul
# Added sysctl.conf example file
#
# Revision 1.3.6.2  2006/09/22 20:28:12  paul
# Added example of simple linux-linux connection using raw RSA keys.
#
# Revision 1.3.6.1  2005/11/01 18:10:07  paul
# dopted Jacco's L2TP example configuration files. I changed them slightly
# from his versions to properly support nat-t and to avoid breaking rekey
# attempts for right=%any. I also changed the pathnames to proper ones,
# removed hardcoded IP addresses and removed explicitely loading the roadwarriors
# certificate (and use rightca=%same instead)
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/12/18 18:13:39  mcr
# 	adjusted Makefiles so that ${OBJDIR} builds work.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/04/03 19:44:45  ken
# FREESWANSRCDIR -> OPENSWANSRCDIR (patch by folken)
#
# Revision 1.1  2004/01/20 19:24:23  sam
# Adding a template .conf file which will disable OE. Can be "include"d until
# such time as there is an oe=yes|no parameter.
#
# Revision 1.4  2002/12/30 07:02:28  mcr
# 	install empty policygroup files by default.
#
# Revision 1.3  2002/08/02 16:01:03  mcr
# 	moved user visible programs to $PREFIX/libexec, while moving
# 	private files to $PREFIX/lib.
#
# Revision 1.2  2002/06/02 22:02:14  mcr
# 	changed TOPDIR->FREESWANSRCDIR in all Makefiles.
# 	(note that linux/net/ipsec/Makefile uses TOPDIR because this is the
# 	kernel sense.)
#
# Revision 1.1  2002/04/24 07:55:32  mcr
# 	#include ${srcdir}..tches and Makefiles for post-reorg compilation.
