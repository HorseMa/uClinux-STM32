.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fIIkeping\fR sends and receives ISAKMP/IKE echo request and echo reply packets\&. These packets are intended for diagnostics purposes, in a manner similar to \fBping\fR(8) does for ICMP echo request/reply packets\&.

.PP
At the time of this writing, the ISAKMP echo request/reply exchange is still an internet\-draft, and is therefore completely non\-standard\&.

.PP
\fIIkeping\fR will bind to the local address given by \fB\-\-ikeaddress\fR and the port number given by \fB\-\-ikeport\fR defaulting to the wildcard address and the ISAKMP port 500\&. An ISAKMP exchange of type 244 (a private use number) is sent to each of the address/ports listed on the command line\&. The exchange number may be overridden by the \fB\-\-exchangenum\fR option\&.

.PP
\fIIkeping\fR then listens for replies, printing them as they are received\&. Replies are of exchange type 245 or the specified exchange number plus 1\&. \fIIkeping\fR will keep listening until it either receives as many echo responses as it sent, or until the timeout period (10 seconds) has been reached\&. Receipt of a packet will reset the timer\&. The \fB\-\-wait\fR option can be used to specify a different timeout period\&.

.PP
If the \fB\-\-listen\fR option is given, then \fIikeping\fR will not send any packets\&. Instead, it will listen for them and reply to each request received\&.

.PP
If the \fB\-\-natt\fR option is given, then \fIikeping\fR will set the socket to permit UDP encapsulated ESP packets\&. This is only useful in listen mode\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
\fBipsec_pluto\fR(8) does not support the ikeping packet yet, and cannot be used as a listener\&. Therefor, one needs to stop pluto and start an ikeping in listen mode to test a remote site\&.
