# $Log: Makefile,v $
# Revision 1.12  2004/12/18 18:13:43  mcr
# 	adjusted Makefiles so that ${OBJDIR} builds work.
#
# Revision 1.11  2004/04/03 19:44:48  ken
# FREESWANSRCDIR -> OPENSWANSRCDIR (patch by folken)
#
# Revision 1.10  2003/12/02 02:35:46  ken
# Stop IPsec *after* NFS, so we don't hang on NFS over IPsec mounts
#
# Revision 1.9  2002/08/10 19:47:06  mcr
# 	added clean:: target to remove "setup" even though it
# 	isn't the value set in PROGRAM
#
# Revision 1.8  2002/06/03 20:25:31  mcr
# 	man page for files actually existant in /proc/net changed back to
# 	ipsec_foo via new EXTRA5PROC process.
#
# Revision 1.7  2002/06/02 21:51:41  mcr
# 	changed TOPDIR->FREESWANSRCDIR in all Makefiles.
# 	(note that linux/net/ipsec/Makefile uses TOPDIR because this is the
# 	kernel sense.)
#
# Revision 1.6  2002/05/27 00:18:51  mcr
# 	updated install_file_list to include ${srcdir}...d/init.d/ipsec file.
#
# Revision 1.5  2002/05/24 03:20:41  mcr
# 	"setup" was installed, but was not the target of the install,
# 	so it was not built from setup.in.
#
# Revision 1.4  2002/05/22 22:05:58  mcr
# 	install setup program properly in /etc/rc.d/init.d/*ipsec*.
#
# Revision 1.3  2002/05/06 19:17:50  mcr
# 	added install_file_list target to gather list of all files that
# 	would be installed by "make install" (for PR#65).
# 	manlink has new "-n" option to just print which files would be
# 	created rather than actually doing it.
#
# Revision 1.2  2002/05/06 18:49:38  mcr
# 	init.d scripts were not properly installed.
#
# Revision 1.1  2002/04/24 07:55:32  mcr
# 	#include ${srcdir}..tches and Makefiles for post-reorg compilation.
