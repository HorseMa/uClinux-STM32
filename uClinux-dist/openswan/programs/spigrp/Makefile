# $Log: Makefile,v $
# Revision 1.7  2004/12/18 18:13:44  mcr
# 	adjusted Makefiles so that ${OBJDIR} builds work.
#
# Revision 1.6  2004/04/12 12:05:53  ken
# Use OPENSWANLIBs

# Revision 1.5  2004/04/03 19:44:49  ken
# FREESWANSRCDIR -> OPENSWANSRCDIR (patch by folken)
#
# Revision 1.4  2002/06/03 20:25:31  mcr
# 	man page for files actually existant in /proc/net changed back to
# 	ipsec_foo via new EXTRA5PROC process.
#
# Revision 1.3  2002/06/02 21:51:41  mcr
# 	changed TOPDIR->FREESWANSRCDIR in all Makefiles.
# 	(note that linux/net/ipsec/Makefile uses TOPDIR because this is the
# 	kernel sense.)
#
# Revision 1.2  2002/04/26 01:21:26  mcr
# 	while tracking down a missing (not installed) /etc/ipsec.conf,
# 	MCR has decided that it is not okay for each program subdir to have
# 	some subset (determined with -f) of possible files.
# 	Each subdir that defines $PROGRAM, MUST have a PROGRAM.8 file as well as a PROGRAM file.
# 	Optional PROGRAM.5 files have been added to the makefiles.
#
# Revision 1.1  2002/04/24 07:55:32  mcr
# 	#include ${srcdir}..tches and Makefiles for post-reorg compilation.
