Intel IXDP2800/2850
-------------------

1. Compiler Tool Chain

   Before you can compile the Linux kernel, libraries and applications to
   generate an IXP2800 image you must install an appropriate compiler tool
   chain. I suggest you use the arm-linux tool chain that accompanies this
   source distribution (the arm-linux-tools-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz package). To
   install this toolchain do:

   1. login as root
   2. cd /
   3. tar xvzf arm-linux-tools-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz

   This package contains binaries of the following tools:

        binutils-2.14
        gcc-3.3.2
        glibc-2.2.5

2. Building the Source

   Follow these simple steps to compile binary images ready to run on the
   Intel IXDP2800 board:

   1.  tar xvzf uClinux-dist-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz
   2.  cd uClinux-dist
   3.  make xconfig

       . Choose the "Target Platform Selection" menu item
       . Select the "Vendor/Product" tab and choose "Intel/IXDP2800"
       . Select the "Libc version" tab and choose "Glibc"
       . "Save and Exit" this configuration

   4.  make dep
   5.  make

   That is it!  The final make step will run through and compile the Linux
   kernel, glibc library and a sample application set. It will also package
   the result into two files ready to load onto the IXDP2800 board, zImage
   and ramdisk.gz.

   Only the linux-2.4.x kernel and glibc libraries can currently be used
   on the IXDP2800 board. The uClibc library can optionaly be used instead
   of glibc.


3. Loading and Running

   You need to configure the IXDP2800 firmware with appropriate IP
   addresses on both the Ingress and Egress ports.

   Copy the binary files from uClinux-dist, images/zImage and
   images/ramdisk.gz to the TFTP area of the download server.

   To load and run Linux on the Intel boot firmware you firstly must
   load onto both the Ingress and Egress processors:

        Ingress>  load \\A.B.C.D\ramdisk.gz 0x1e000000
        Ingress>  load \\A.B.C.D\zImage 0x1c008000
        Egress>  load \\A.B.C.D\ramdisk.gz 0x1e000000
        Egress>  load \\A.B.C.D\zImage 0x1c008000

   where A.B.C.D is the IP address of you tftp server.
   Start the kernel on the Ingress processor first, followed by the
   Egress processor:

        Ingress>  launch 0x1c008000
        Egress>  launch 0x1c008000

   You should see the Linux boot banner, and then be presented with a
   bash shell prompt. A reasonable utility set is in place, mostly using
   the busybox tool set. By default the rc script will run a dhcp client,
   and so with a local dhcp server in place Linux will acquire an IP
   address.


4. Customizing the Build

   Using "make xconfig" in uClinux-dist you can customize the kernel and
   application configurations. There is a large selection of packages in
   the application configuration.

   Consult the README file at the top level of uClinux-dist for some more
   information about configuration and building.

   Note also that uClinux-dist is just the Linux kernel and normal
   application set. It does not contain any of the Intel EDK or other
   support tools for the IXDP2800 platforms.
