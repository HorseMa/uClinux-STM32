Cirrus EDB9312
--------------

To build for this target you will need a working arm-linux- tool chain.
You can get a binary toolchain from www.snapgear.org.

The linux-2.4.x kernel should be used and either glibc or uClibc(recommended).

When you have finished compiling you can load the images created in the
"images" directory using redboot and a tftp server with the following
commands.  This assumes the tftp file server is at IP address 192.168.0.2
and the EDB9312 is IP 192.168.0.1:

	RedBoot> ip -l 192.168.0.1 -h 192.168.0.2
	RedBoot> load -v -r -b 0x1000000 ramdisk.gz
	RedBoot> load -v -r -b 0x218000 zImage
	RedBoot> exec -r 0x1000000 0x218000

The default is to boot with the console on the LCD,  you can plug a PS2
PC keyboard into the keyboard port and interact with the box.  If you
disable the frame buffer then you will get a serial console at 57600
on the console port that RedBoot runs on.

The keyboard appears a little flakey,  it misses keys etc.  I haven't looked
at this.  Currently the SnapGear 2.4 kernel contains Cirrus version 1.4.2
patches.
