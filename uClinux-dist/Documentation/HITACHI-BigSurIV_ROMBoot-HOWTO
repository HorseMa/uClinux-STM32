HITACHI BigSurIV ROM Boot patch
-------------------------------


This patch will add an additional option in the kernel configuration to have
the kernel boot from ROM instead of needing to be copied to RAM first.

To apply this patch, go into the following directory,

cd uClinux-dist
and run
patch -p0 < $PATCH_LOCATION/linux-sh-ROMBoot.patch


This will give you a new option in the kernel configuration called
"Boot kernel from ROM". Select this option if you want to have the
kernel code segment running from ROM.

Then you will need to give the offset into the ROM where you wish
to store/run the image from.

You will then need to modify your boot loader to jump into the specified
offset + 0x1000. So if the offset is specified as 0x100000 (the default),
then your boot loader needs to jump to 0x101000 to boot the kernel.

Also, remove any code for copying the image into RAM. Any copying that
needs to be done will be done by the kernel itself.
